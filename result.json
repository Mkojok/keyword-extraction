Service at the breakfast wasn't as good as I remembered it to be.\nAs we had stayed at a brand new hotel for the first 2 nights, coming back to Solage on the 3rd night made me feel like I wouldn't want to come back again.\n\nThe breakfast area wasn't even that busy, but seemed to take forever to get served. I ordered oatmeal for breakfast but when I asked for milk for the oatmeal, it took 3 tries before I got anything.\n\nHad a spa treatment at the last minute. The spa was good and relaxing - as you would expect from a 5* hotel. I wouldn't say it is the best, but was good enough a treat on a holiday. Something you would expect when you pay high prices and service charge for."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "This is about the third or fourth time we have stayed at Solage. The prices have gone up big time and I feel the service has declined a bit.\nWe checked in and the girl helping us didn't seem very tenured or experienced in the hospitality business. If I wanted to I probably could have made her cry and want to quit but the yogi in me refrained. We asked for a tub in our room and she said they were committed and couldn't upgrade us. Since when is a tub an upgrade?! I literally saw about two or three other couples or the same folks the next two days. They were not booked solid as we were there Sun-Wed. I feel like we were lied to.\n\nService around the pools was fine and the staff nice, but for a resort of this caliber there should be more. The wine in the cans offered tasted very bad. The food was very overpriced. The lounge chairs are not padded and somewhat uncomfortable. We hung out at the pool and used the gym and steam/sauna rooms often. I took 3 yoga classes. Two of the classes by Deanne were great although we didn't do much \"flow or warrior poses\". The other teacher Urlika didn't really teach yoga but more like a sports stretching class dubbed as \"therapeutic yoga\". I was expecting more of a yin or restorative type. Nonetheless I enjoyed the classes and the yoga room is beautiful. All the equipment is great.\n\nThe room: We love the room and outdoor patio. It's rustic, modern and spacious. The bed is comfy but pillows to mushy. I asked for a thicker pillow but the one they brought was too stiff and high. They could use a pillow bar with the prices they charge. We love the nespresso machine although its noisy in the morning when your partner is sleeping. There is coffee outside the front desk which is nice to have. We were able to picnic outside our room with wine and cheese. The staff brought us ice right away. The bikes could use some maintenance. Mine had a low tire and both were very dusty. These should be in tip top shape when paying close to $700 a night! I will say the hotel needs to spray for bugs a bit more. I saw spiders and a roach or something crawling on the floor as we were checking out. I have seen other reviews about ants but we didn't have that problem.\n\nSolbar: We ate here but only had the bar menu and sat on the other side of the main restaurant but outdoors. The hostess said the main restaurant was full although I saw many empty tables. The burger was great but the plate could have better presentation for $20. Thought the fries could be thicker and more home made like. Service was pretty good. The rest of the portions seemed to be small. We shared the cheesecake for dessert and that was large and fantastic.\n\nOur room rate included breakfast and I thought the food was really good. Fresh and quality ingredients. The donuts were fabulous at the end. Coffee was tasty too. We both had omelets, regular and egg whites with goat cheese and spinach. I think we enjoyed lounging at breakfast the most. Although our waiter bailed on us and went on break without telling us. Kept us waiting on the check and our last minute donut order.\n\nPro's:\nSo close to Calistoga. Fun to ride the bikes into town. Great market in town as well to buy cheese and bread. Near some fun wineries and off the Silverado trail.\nLoved the grounds, pools, spa amenities, etc. The cottages are very private and all have small outdoor spaces to lounge; great for the hotter months. Loved the in room coffee and drinks. Turndown service is a nice touch with chocolate and water. The gym and yoga studio is very nice.\nThe valet and check in staff was nice. The welcome wine is a good touch but they should include a bottle in the room as well.\nWhen we did call for extra pillows, ice etc. there was prompt service and delivery!\n\nThings they can work on:\nWeeks before I emailed concierge to ask for a list of wineries they recommend. I was expecting something tailored and unique. Instead they sent pdfs of the entire region. Not really custom and didn't offer to help with creating an itinerary or reservations. I was expecting a little more service here.\n\nUpon check in the front desk staff thanked us for our multiple stays but it would be a nice gesture to send something like wine, champagne or snacks to the room for our loyalty.\n\nThe staff was very nice but no one went out of their way. Something you would expect paying $700 a night.\n\nOn multiple occasions the staff asked for our last name (esp at Solbar) and then only addressed my husband as Mr. (our last name) and not me. I thought this was a bit old school.\n\nThere should be snacks and hot drinks in the spa waiting area.\n\nOverall a nice and enjoyable stay but we are thinking of trying other spots nearby on our next jaunt!"}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "The staff when we arrived were helpful and made us feel wanted.

Looking for the bathroom we both excited in two directions and ran into each other in the bathroom behind the bed. There was no door on the shower, thankfully there was one on the closet. If you took a shower you were in plain site.The phrase \"I am in the shower\" became a watchword or not , watch word. I am not a prude but I do like to be on my own , privately in the shower.

I'm glad we were able to try out both hotels because one was romantic and rustic, whereas Solage was livelier and busy.\n\nThe Solage rooms are lovely; they're like little bungalows that opens to the outside wooded area. Each room comes with 2 bikes, so we were able to take advantage of it around the resort. The bed was comfy, bathroom was lovely and the room came with a wonderful bottle of wine.\n\nWe also tried Solbar for breakfast - food was great, service was okay, ambiance was meh. It took a really long time to give our order, but our server was apologetic. The atmosphere felt super stuffy - we overheard a patron demanding to order something from the brunch menu when it was already past breakfast time. We were seated by a table next to the older couple, and it felt extremely awkward when they demanded, complained and whined about wanting specific pancakes because they \"always have to have the pancakes\". I don't think I would patron the restaurant just because of the weird, stuffy ambiance that caters to an older crowd. Surprisingly, when we patroned the restaurant at Calistoga Ranch, the ambiance was so much better.\n\nOverall, I would probably go back to Calistoga Ranch over Solage, but it was still a wonderful, fun experience."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "We had the pleasure of staying in Calistoga as we were attending a wedding at a winery nearby. We had visited the spa before which was totally fab (both the services and the pool) and always knew that we wanted to come back for a stay.

Aside from the pool, we made use of the gym facilities which are also quite nice for hotel standards. And we ate breakfast at Solbar twice which was delicious. The room was very comfortable even if it wasn't super interesting. We really enjoyed the large shower."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "Really enjoyed our visit here to relax for the most part. The pools are not crowed during the week. All the staff were really nice. My husband enjoyed taking the Mercedes sports car out for spin (free for four hours).

Construction started at 7am with beeping noises and went until 7pm the night we were there. They need to put in more loud waterfalls or something to drown out the sounds until the new hotel is completed.\n\nA perfect place to relax when things are quiet."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "We just got back from our second trip to Solage and are already planning to go back. There's just something about how peaceful the resort is and we loved that the pool/mineral pool/hot tubs are open year round.

Customer service was again excellent."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "There should have been two reviews: one for the hotel and the other one for the spa. Let's start on a positive note - staying at Solage is a splurge, but it worth every penny they charge: sleek and stylish decor, beautiful rooms, probably the best sheets I have ever slept on! Just soaking in their huge mineral pool for few hours seems like a complete vacation.\nThis time, I decided to enhance my experience by adding a spa package: mud-bath and massage. As the whole place, the spa is beautifully designed. That is pretty much for the positive experience. The service felt rushed and superficial.\nWe got a package with the silly name, something like \"double your pleasure\" for $475 for two people. The package included a light lunch at Solbar (shared appetizer, two entrees, no alcohol), two 50-minute massages and two so-called \"mudslides\". Mudslide experience is nothing more than a fancy way of stretching a simple 20-min mud treatment into becoming the \"experience\" worth well over $100. After your 20 min are up, you are invited to soak in a mineral \"hydro-bath\" (same water as in their outdoor pool, and pretty much everywhere in Calistoga).\nJust to add minutes to your service, you are then guided to relax in a Brookstone-type of a reclining vibrating chair. The whole ritual feels artificial and is totally overpriced, in my opinion.\nThe shea butter massage was basically a gentle application of a shea butter mixture. Although very pleasant and relaxing, the experience lacked an essential ingredient - the massage itself! The therapist was so arrogant and detached that I did not dare to demand some pressure. To cope with my disappointment, I promising myself that I would never allow to rip myself of another $500, and just tried to relax through the \"treatment\".\nConclusion: hotel - 5 stars, spa - 1 star for relaxing music, averaging 3 stars."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "Oh wow, I'm not sure where to start. Getting there wasn't easy (the traffic from SFO was horrendous....my friends flew in to Sacramento and it was SO much easier) but, once I arrived it was all good. I didn't even have to get out of my car to check in (or out). They brought me bottles of ice cold water and then led me to my cottage, unloaded the car and wanted to know what else they could do for me. I went to dinner with my friends and the meal was sublime. And, of course, the wine was the best. My cottage was roomy and comfortable and my patio was private. The place looks spread out (it's all cottages) but, in reality, I was able to get to the cottages of everyone who was there with us (we were there for a wedding) easily. The pool was great (we used the kiddy pool having a 2 year old with us- there is an adults only pool), toured the spa (no time to use it, unfortunately) and ate most of our meals there. The wedding setting couldn't have been lovelier (a \"sunken\" lawn area surrounded by a flower garden with the mountains as a back drop), the reception was in a large room right next to the garden and included a large outdoor seating area. The staff had signs posted at all access points that this was a private event and we had no crashers that I was aware of. I can't say enough about how wonderful the location, entire set-up and staff was. They were out of sight most of the time unless you needed something and then they appeared, as if by magic, to cater to your every wish. We will be going back for a 5 day \"girls\" trip to take advantage of the spa and all the fitness classes. Oh, and every cabin comes with bicycles. It's about a mile of flat road to town which has much to offer in food, wine tasting and art galleries. There is also a shuttle to many of the wineries in the area and many have an agreement with Solage so you get a reduced rate as a Solage guest. The wifi was free but of average speed. But then, we only used our cells or iPads....I never unpacked my computer."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "Ahh, the Solage in Calistoga used to be our special place which is why I am truly bummed to write this review. When we needed a weekend away from the city we'd head up there for peace and quiet and exquisite service. I didn't realize they had spun off from Auberge prior to our last visit, which explains the decline in management/service. I want to be clear here- heading up to the Solage is (was?) a treat. Spending nearly $700 on one night away for dinner and accommodations is a TREAT, a special occasion. So when I get there, I want it to be flawless and I just want to be in a calm, sweet, unbothered mood.\n\nMy email confirmation said check-in time was 3pm, we got there at 3 and they told us check-in wasn't until 4pm (I still have that confirmation email, and wish I had shown the manager, but I was trying to be polite) Hmm, ok. So we went to the pool to have a swim and relax and wait. By the time they told us our room was ready it 4:45. We got to the room and it smelled heavily of smoke. So we asked for another room. We had to wait for another 30 minutes while they found us a room that didn't smell like a chimney. By the time we were settled in our new room it 5:45. No complaints once we were in the room though. The next morning we woke up and decided to hit up yoga/ the gym, and then head to breakfast. On our way to breakfast I swung past reception to ask for an extended check out, since we had such a late start on our stay the day before. The lady at reception said all she could offer me was an extra 30 minutes, which is just ridiculous. Once she saw how upset I was she said she could accommodate an hour extension. Good grief, this is not a negotiation. And heres the best part, we went back to the room to relax after after breakfast and housekeeping came into the room TWICE in that hour. Way to communicate with the rest of your team. When you're paying this much for a stay at a \"lux\" resort, these types of mistakes shouldn't be happening and in fact, they hadn't happened any of the previous times we'd stayed at the Solage in the past. Previously, management would send champagne to our room for no reason at all or if they found out we were celebrating something, give you chai tea upon check-in, if they saw you playing bocce they'd send over some wine to make the game a little more fun, people would call to check in with us to make sure we had everything we needed, and it just felt like a more smoothly run, thoughtful operation. Like I wrote in my title, Now I just feel like they're riding on their own coat tails of what they used to be. Is this a nice property? Yes. Its gorgeous and quiet and romantic and lovely. Is it deserving of 5 stars? Definitely not. For what it is, it has become average. And you know what? In not one of the conversations I had while I was there, did anyone I spoke to apologize for the inconveniences. (Save for the housekeeper, and it wasn't even her fault!)\n\nI have to say- SpaSolage and SolBar are not included in this review. They are both still fabulous, and I will continue to head up there for the day to soak in the mineral pool and eat at the restaurant but it'll be a while before I consider staying at the hotel again."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "My wife and I visited the Solage Calistoga for our honeymoon over the Christmas holiday.

We then made our way to our room which was peaceful and cozy; equipped with a fireplace and a large soaking tub that helped us shed any residual wedding planning stress.\n\nIf I could choose one word to describe Solage it would be: serenity. The grounds are peaceful, well maintained, and quiet. The Spa is lovely. We had a couple's massage and then did the mudbath/soaking experience. The resort was crowded for the holidays, but the staff did an excellent job of making your feel cared for by providing what felt like a very individualized experience. I was impressed at how it could really provide for all types of guests: a lesbian couple (us), older couples, families, etc.\n\nAlso, the Mercedes rental program is an interesting perk. We decided to borrow one the vehicles for the day, and while we would not typically partake in something like that we just decided why not?! It was our honeymoon after all! It was fun to drive around Napa Valley in a convertible for the afternoon and live a life that seems only real in movies.\n\nFinally the food. Their restaurant is Michelin rated, so obviously it's really tasty. We had breakfast in the morning as part of out package, and it was delicious. We at dinner their Christmas Day, and it was just superb. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nBottom Line: While the Solage may be in the more northern part of Napa Valley, we liked having that added privacy. Nothing is too far of a drive, and you can do it in style when borrowing one of the Mercedes. It was a great way for us to experience Napa for the first time!

Maybe it was a case of bad timing/luck for us during our stay. In the end, we felt relaxed and enjoyed our time (mission accomplished), but left feeling the service we received at the spa and restaurant made us question the level of quality promoted by the resort.\n\n1) Reception - Reception was very welcoming. Offered us chai tea and water. Thanked us for choosing them for our babymoon, confirmed our reservations at the spa, and reviewed the \"Just the Two of Us\" package we purchased. The welcome packet included our spa itineraries which was helpful because we forgot our reservation times.\n2) Room - Our Adara Studio was great. The layout and high ceilings made it feel large and open. The bath products smelled great. My wife enjoyed the bath salts provided when she took a bath.

He told us highlights about the restaurant and noted its Michelin rating. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The portions were great and frankly more than we expected. We returned for breakfast on day two of babymoon for another delicious meal. The donuts were awesome and softer than pillows used by angels. Dinner on night two was drastically different and very frustrating.

As it turns out my masseur had my appointment time 15 minutes earlier and my wife's masseur arrived for her 15 minutes later than our same scheduled times. I'm not a massage person (1 every 8 years), but I thought our Couples Massage meant we would be in a room together. As it turns out we were in separate rooms. I could have said something, but I was under the impression my wife had already been was whisked away to her massage. After our massages we met by the heated pool, had a snack and a smoothie for a snack before our mudslide. My wife informed of the delay with her appointment, that her massage was actually a little more that 30 minutes, and that when walking to her massage room she mentioned to her masseur about her prenatal massage. This news was a surprise to him and he had to get more pillows. Afterwards we did the spas Mudslide experience which was very relaxing. Each stage of the experience just took us one step closer to relaxation.

The provided bike are a fun and easy way to get around the property.\n\nThe spa is great! Awesome array of services and very spacious. I wish the staff had been better about enforcing the calm/serene vibe, however. There was a very loud group of women making a lot of noise the whole time. There is a pool on the other end of the property and I think that is a more appropriate place for that noise.\n\nOverall, the quality of food was disappointing on property. You can see my review of Solbar for more info. We also ordered smoothies at the spa and they were full of sugar and purees instead of the fresh seasonal ingredients we expected. We have stayed at many Auberge properties and other properties in the Napa Valley area and the food quality did not measure up.\n\nWe would return again to enjoy the spa, but will probably try other places in the area first in search of larger rooms and better food."}, {"Keyword": "nothing", "Text": "My much anticipated visit to Solage was a HUGE disappointment.

We had a great experience. The Mercedes program and restaurant (Solbar) are what sets this resort apart from the rest, and I must say the level of service was exceptional.\n\nPro's: In my opinion, great service really can make a stay much more enjoyable, and the staff at Solage did a great job. We did not come across one employee that was not attentive and polite.The restaurant is awesome, both for dinner and breakfast. We had breakfast included in our package and they really do a nice job. French pressed coffee, great menu options and of course, their famous doughnuts. You will not leave hungry as the portions are hearty. It is a Michelin rated restaurant and it certainly lived up to the reputation. At dinner I ordered the braised short rib with polenta and it was phenomenal. Our server was outstanding, unfortunately, I cannot remember his name (we put in a good word with his manager) but he was attentive, funny and made a great wine selection for us. There are numerous hiking trails in the area that made for a good way to get moving outdoors, if hiking is not your thing the pool is large enough to get a good swim in and has a large hot tub. Bocce ball was a nice touch as well.\n\nNow the cars: For our entire stay we had access to a $140K Mercedes SL. There is nothing like driving through Napa with the top down in a car like this. We had a blast. At night we took the SUV out to dinner in Calistoga. To me this was the best ammenity Solage offered. The bikes a great, dont get me wrong, but the cars just take the cake. Being that it was the slow season, they were not too strict about us returning the cars on time and we used the SL day and night for 4 days straight. One day they let us park it by our room because we were going to Napa for dinner that night. Awesome.\n\nCons: The rooms were basic. Very comfortable and clean but for the price point these rooms are offered at, I expected a little more. If you are looking for luxury, you will not find it in the rooms, rather you will get a neat and clean cottage feel. Not a big deal, as the vibe here really isnt supposed to be luxurious, its more of a contemporary laid back feel. The spa left alot to be desired, we were rushed through each phase of our spa treaments and it is pretty much impossible to enjoy yourself when you know the staff wants to hurry you through. If I could have done it over again I would have cancelled my appointment, as it was more stressful than relaxing.\n\nOverall it was a great experience, due to the access to the cars, the staff and the restaurant. If we did not have the access to their fleet I would have ranked Solage with one less star. The Mercedes program really is a fantastic service that cant be beat. I am not sure if I would stay again simply because for the price point I think you can find a little more bang for your buck, however I am pleased that we stayed at Solage."}, {"Keyword": "nothing", "Text": "I used to love Solage, not anymore. I used to recommend Solage to friends, not anymore.\n\nThe whole reason you pay for overpriced spa services at a nice hotel is so that you can relax both with the spa services and facilities. If I wanted a better massage at 50% of the price, I could easily do that anywhere.\n\nI'm a few hours drive to Solage, so I've been there before and never had a problem after paying for expensive spa services to also lounge for a few hours by the pool. I've also never had a problem doing this at any other high-end resort, and we paid $400 in massages to do exactly that. It costs them nothing to allow you to sit by the pools (this isn't a scarce resource) and if you stay longer, you buy more things -- it's a win-win on both sides.\n\nBut now, they want to charge each person a $50 day-resort fee IN ADDITION to the $400 we paid for massages, so let's see, $500 to basically sit by the pool.\n\nThey said this was stated on a email confirmation which I never received. Moreover, when I told them we would not be paying their resort fee and would be leaving instead, it still took them two tries to fix it -- they just \"discounted it\" first and hoped I wouldn't notice. The whole exchange took almost an hour of our time and made me wish we had never come to Solage in the first place.\n\nSince I've been there a few times for spa services, here are my reviews:\n\nTheir \"signature mud slide\" involves a small pail of mud that you paint on yourself and then a weird vibrating chair. There's really no service involved (the people there don't do the treatment) and it isn't useful for anything except having a laugh.\n\nThe massage was good, but not great -- I still had knots in my back. For $200, you can get a lot more somewhere else. If you can't use the facilities for 1-2 hours, what's the difference between coming here and going to a less glitzy massage parlor elsewhere?\n\nMy recommendation, go somewhere else. If they don't want their guests to have a good time and return, I'd suggest to spend your money with someone who will."}, {"Keyword": "nothing", "Text": "Such a mediocre hotel asking high prices. Stayed two nights this past weekend, Friday and Saturday. One of the key requirements for the hotel was having late night in room dining because we were going to be coming back very late and Napa is obviously an early closing town. The hotel website (edit, see here, dated 6/2015: solagecalistoga.com/wp-c\u2026) and the front desk confirmed there was in room dining available 24 hours - it specifically says so on the fact sheet and in the hotel details! Of course, when we tried to order, not only was nothing available but the attendant didn't even try to help. Instead, the rude person on the phone said - why don't you just wait till tomorrow! False advertising at its finest.\n\nNext morning, 8:30am, rudely awakened by housekeeping banging on the door of the 'studio' (which, by the way, has no privacy - there are people walking by right outside on your 'patio') and the walls are paper-thin. I asked housekeeping to come back later, but could still hear them cleaning/talking in the adjoining room. Of course when I returned at the end of the day, the room hadn't been cleaned. I told the front desk about this at checkout -- the guy just shrugged and said 'well, I think you'll get an email asking for feedback'\n\nThis is one of those 'trying to be hip' properties that can't even get the basics right - and the attitude is just insufferable. Auberge, which is a fantastic property, recently sold their stake in this one - perhaps that's where the service and quality went downhill. Many better places to stay in the area - Auberge, Merrywood, or even a charming b+b - at least they promise what they can deliver, unlike this place.

Just soaking in their huge mineral pool for few hours seems like a complete vacation.\nThis time, I decided to enhance my experience by adding a spa package: mud-bath and massage. As the whole place, the spa is beautifully designed. That is pretty much for the positive experience.

The package included a light lunch at Solbar (shared appetizer, two entrees, no alcohol), two 50-minute massages and two so-called \"mudslides\". Mudslide experience is nothing more than a fancy way of stretching a simple 20-min mud treatment into becoming the \"experience\" worth well over $100. After your 20 min are up, you are invited to soak in a mineral \"hydro-bath\" (same water as in their outdoor pool, and pretty much everywhere in Calistoga).\nJust to add minutes to your service, you are then guided to relax in a Brookstone-type of a reclining vibrating chair. The whole ritual feels artificial and is totally overpriced, in my opinion.\nThe shea butter massage was basically a gentle application of a shea butter mixture. Although very pleasant and relaxing, the experience lacked an essential ingredient - the massage itself! The therapist was so arrogant and detached that I did not dare to demand some pressure. To cope with my disappointment, I promising myself that I would never allow to rip myself of another $500, and just tried to relax through the \"treatment\".\nConclusion: hotel - 5 stars, spa - 1 star for relaxing music, averaging 3 stars."}, {"Keyword": "nothing", "Text": "My husband and I spent two nights at the Solage in a Vega King Studio suite in May. Overall a good stay, but had a few issues that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The property itself is very nice. The suites are free standing units scattered across the resort. The rooms are lovely. Comfortable, large King beds and really big spa like bathrooms. You also have your own patio/sitting area in front of your suite. There are bicycles for your use at the suite. We utilized them when going to different areas on the property. The pool area is wonderful! There is an adult pool and a separate family pool. The adult pool area was quiet and very relaxing. Not crowded at all during the time we were there. Service at the pool was very good. We had lunch by the pool that was good.\n\nWe had breakfast and dinner at the Solbar restaurant at the property. I highly recommend the restaurant. It was soooo good! Both breakfast and dinner were fantastic! Nice wine selection as well.\n\nWe also utilized the spa and had the couples massage. The massages were OK...maybe I was expecting it to be a little better considering how expensive it was....there was nothing wrong with it - but I have definitely had much better. The spa area itself is nice. There is a separate pool area with cabanas. We hung out by the spa pool after our messages and that was relaxing.\n\nThe biggest issue with our stay was the noise at night. Since the units have the outdoor patio areas, we unfortunately found that people staying around us did not know how to observe any type of \"quiet time\" at night. There were people outside listening to music, laughing, and talking loudly into the early morning hours. On the second night I had to call the front desk because it was 3AM and they were still going strong. I know this is not the fault of the property, however I realized that there were no notices about observing \"quiet time\" when outside after a certain hour or not playing music outside on your patio after a certain hour. While this should be a common respect that people display when they know they are outside on a patio right beside of others... unfortunately there are many people who don't have this respect. When you stay at a place like the Solage with your husband, you are wanting a relaxing, romantic environment - not to be woken up by people partying every night. After we called about the issue the second night, I do think that someone from the office came out and spoke with our neighbors - however I was disappointed that we were not even given an apology by management.\n\nIn summary, I loved the property itself, but because of the noise issue it was not the relaxing stay that I wanted and I would unfortunately be hesitant to go back."}, {"Keyword": "nothing", "Text": "My husband and I visited Napa for the first time and I must say we could not get enough of it.\nAs we both enjoy a good wine, fine dining and a beautiful hotel this place exceeded all of our expectations.\nAs we pulled up to the hotel we were greeted outside and checked in for the convenience of not having to get out of our car!!!

We had to pay upfront including a mandatory 20% tip and I had to carry my credit card in my robe to order any food or beverages. Again, not high-end treatment, although our smoothy was $11. We mistakenly did not read about the 3-step treatment on the website and no one shared the process, although we did tell them it was our first time at the spa.\n\nThe mud treatment consists of a self-application of mud from a bucket with ash and essential oil in a heated communal shower room. There were 3 towels and water on the ledge for us to relax while the mud caked on us. After 15-20 minutes a man knocked on the door and we were told to wash off. He knocked again and we walked to soaking tubs in an unembellished room. We sat in the tub for 15-20 minutes (no music) until he knocked again. We re-robed (yes, they were now wet) and went to a room with semi reclined chair and a comforter. We placed headphones on our ears and sat in this \"vibrating\" chair for 15 minutes. Yes, the base from the music caused a little vibration if you turned up the volume, but then that hurt my ears.

We decided to borrow one the vehicles for the day, and while we would not typically partake in something like that we just decided why not?! It was our honeymoon after all! It was fun to drive around Napa Valley in a convertible for the afternoon and live a life that seems only real in movies.\n\nFinally the food.

Maybe it was a case of bad timing/luck for us during our stay. In the end, we felt relaxed and enjoyed our time (mission accomplished), but left feeling the service we received at the spa and restaurant made us question the level of quality promoted by the resort.\n\n1) Reception - Reception was very welcoming. Offered us chai tea and water. Thanked us for choosing them for our babymoon, confirmed our reservations at the spa, and reviewed the \"Just the Two of Us\" package we purchased. The welcome packet included our spa itineraries which was helpful because we forgot our reservation times.\n2) Room - Our Adara Studio was great. The layout and high ceilings made it feel large and open. The bath products smelled great. My wife enjoyed the bath salts provided when she took a bath.

As it turns out my masseur had my appointment time 15 minutes earlier and my wife's masseur arrived for her 15 minutes later than our same scheduled times. I'm not a massage person (1 every 8 years), but I thought our Couples Massage meant we would be in a room together. As it turns out we were in separate rooms. I could have said something, but I was under the impression my wife had already been was whisked away to her massage. After our massages we met by the heated pool, had a snack and a smoothie for a snack before our mudslide. My wife informed of the delay with her appointment, that her massage was actually a little more that 30 minutes, and that when walking to her massage room she mentioned to her masseur about her prenatal massage. This news was a surprise to him and he had to get more pillows. Afterwards we did the spas Mudslide experience which was very relaxing.

Since when is a tub an upgrade?! I literally saw about two or three other couples or the same folks the next two days. They were not booked solid as we were there Sun-Wed. I feel like we were lied to.\n\nService around the pools was fine and the staff nice, but for a resort of this caliber there should be more. The wine in the cans offered tasted very bad. The food was very overpriced. The lounge chairs are not padded and somewhat uncomfortable. We hung out at the pool and used the gym and steam/sauna rooms often. I took 3 yoga classes. Two of the classes by Deanne were great although we didn't do much \"flow or warrior poses\". The other teacher Urlika didn't really teach yoga but more like a sports stretching class dubbed as \"therapeutic yoga\". I was expecting more of a yin or restorative type. Nonetheless I enjoyed the classes and the yoga room is beautiful. All the equipment is great.\n\nThe room: We love the room and outdoor patio. It's rustic, modern and spacious. The bed is comfy but pillows to mushy. I asked for a thicker pillow but the one they brought was too stiff and high. They could use a pillow bar with the prices they charge. We love the nespresso machine although its noisy in the morning when your partner is sleeping. There is coffee outside the front desk which is nice to have. We were able to picnic outside our room with wine and cheese. The staff brought us ice right away. The bikes could use some maintenance. Mine had a low tire and both were very dusty.

I saw spiders and a roach or something crawling on the floor as we were checking out. I have seen other reviews about ants but we didn't have that problem.\n\nSolbar: We ate here but only had the bar menu and sat on the other side of the main restaurant but outdoors. The hostess said the main restaurant was full although I saw many empty tables. The burger was great but the plate could have better presentation for $20. Thought the fries could be thicker and more home made like. Service was pretty good. The rest of the portions seemed to be small. We shared the cheesecake for dessert and that was large and fantastic.\n\nOur room rate included breakfast and I thought the food was really good. Fresh and quality ingredients.

Great market in town as well to buy cheese and bread. Near some fun wineries and off the Silverado trail.\nLoved the grounds, pools, spa amenities, etc. The cottages are very private and all have small outdoor spaces to lounge; great for the hotter months. Loved the in room coffee and drinks. Turndown service is a nice touch with chocolate and water. The gym and yoga studio is very nice.\nThe valet and check in staff was nice. The welcome wine is a good touch but they should include a bottle in the room as well.\nWhen we did call for extra pillows, ice etc. there was prompt service and delivery!\n\nThings they can work on:\nWeeks before I emailed concierge to ask for a list of wineries they recommend. I was expecting something tailored and unique. Instead they sent pdfs of the entire region. Not really custom and didn't offer to help with creating an itinerary or reservations. I was expecting a little more service here.\n\nUpon check in the front desk staff thanked us for our multiple stays but it would be a nice gesture to send something like wine, champagne or snacks to the room for our loyalty.\n\nThe staff was very nice but no one went out of their way. Something you would expect paying $700 a night.\n\nOn multiple occasions the staff asked for our last name (esp at Solbar) and then only addressed my husband as Mr. (our last name) and not me.

The service felt rushed and superficial.\nWe got a package with the silly name, something like \"double your pleasure\" for $475 for two people. The package included a light lunch at Solbar (shared appetizer, two entrees, no alcohol), two 50-minute massages and two so-called \"mudslides\". Mudslide experience is nothing more than a fancy way of stretching a simple 20-min mud treatment into becoming the \"experience\" worth well over $100. After your 20 min are up, you are invited to soak in a mineral \"hydro-bath\" (same water as in their outdoor pool, and pretty much everywhere in Calistoga).\nJust to add minutes to your service, you are then guided to relax in a Brookstone-type of a reclining vibrating chair. The whole ritual feels artificial and is totally overpriced, in my opinion.\nThe shea butter massage was basically a gentle application of a shea butter mixture. Although very pleasant and relaxing, the experience lacked an essential ingredient - the massage itself! The therapist was so arrogant and detached that I did not dare to demand some pressure. To cope with my disappointment, I promising myself that I would never allow to rip myself of another $500, and just tried to relax through the \"treatment\".\nConclusion: hotel - 5 stars, spa - 1 star for relaxing music, averaging 3 stars."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "Oh wow, I'm not sure where to start. Getting there wasn't easy (the traffic from SFO was horrendous....my friends flew in to Sacramento and it was SO much easier) but, once I arrived it was all good. I didn't even have to get out of my car to check in (or out). They brought me bottles of ice cold water and then led me to my cottage, unloaded the car and wanted to know what else they could do for me. I went to dinner with my friends and the meal was sublime. And, of course, the wine was the best. My cottage was roomy and comfortable and my patio was private. The place looks spread out (it's all cottages) but, in reality, I was able to get to the cottages of everyone who was there with us (we were there for a wedding) easily. The pool was great (we used the kiddy pool having a 2 year old with us- there is an adults only pool), toured the spa (no time to use it, unfortunately) and ate most of our meals there. The wedding setting couldn't have been lovelier (a \"sunken\" lawn area surrounded by a flower garden with the mountains as a back drop), the reception was in a large room right next to the garden and included a large outdoor seating area. The staff had signs posted at all access points that this was a private event and we had no crashers that I was aware of. I can't say enough about how wonderful the location, entire set-up and staff was. They were out of sight most of the time unless you needed something and then they appeared, as if by magic, to cater to your every wish. We will be going back for a 5 day \"girls\" trip to take advantage of the spa and all the fitness classes. Oh, and every cabin comes with bicycles. It's about a mile of flat road to town which has much to offer in food, wine tasting and art galleries. There is also a shuttle to many of the wineries in the area and many have an agreement with Solage so you get a reduced rate as a Solage guest. The wifi was free but of average speed. But then, we only used our cells or iPads....I never unpacked my computer."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "Ahh, the Solage in Calistoga used to be our special place which is why I am truly bummed to write this review. When we needed a weekend away from the city we'd head up there for peace and quiet and exquisite service. I didn't realize they had spun off from Auberge prior to our last visit, which explains the decline in management/service. I want to be clear here- heading up to the Solage is (was?) a treat. Spending nearly $700 on one night away for dinner and accommodations is a TREAT, a special occasion. So when I get there, I want it to be flawless and I just want to be in a calm, sweet, unbothered mood.\n\nMy email confirmation said check-in time was 3pm, we got there at 3 and they told us check-in wasn't until 4pm (I still have that confirmation email, and wish I had shown the manager, but I was trying to be polite) Hmm, ok. So we went to the pool to have a swim and relax and wait. By the time they told us our room was ready it 4:45. We got to the room and it smelled heavily of smoke. So we asked for another room. We had to wait for another 30 minutes while they found us a room that didn't smell like a chimney. By the time we were settled in our new room it 5:45. No complaints once we were in the room though. The next morning we woke up and decided to hit up yoga/ the gym, and then head to breakfast. On our way to breakfast I swung past reception to ask for an extended check out, since we had such a late start on our stay the day before. The lady at reception said all she could offer me was an extra 30 minutes, which is just ridiculous. Once she saw how upset I was she said she could accommodate an hour extension. Good grief, this is not a negotiation. And heres the best part, we went back to the room to relax after after breakfast and housekeeping came into the room TWICE in that hour. Way to communicate with the rest of your team. When you're paying this much for a stay at a \"lux\" resort, these types of mistakes shouldn't be happening and in fact, they hadn't happened any of the previous times we'd stayed at the Solage in the past. Previously, management would send champagne to our room for no reason at all or if they found out we were celebrating something, give you chai tea upon check-in, if they saw you playing bocce they'd send over some wine to make the game a little more fun, people would call to check in with us to make sure we had everything we needed, and it just felt like a more smoothly run, thoughtful operation. Like I wrote in my title, Now I just feel like they're riding on their own coat tails of what they used to be. Is this a nice property? Yes. Its gorgeous and quiet and romantic and lovely. Is it deserving of 5 stars? Definitely not. For what it is, it has become average. And you know what? In not one of the conversations I had while I was there, did anyone I spoke to apologize for the inconveniences. (Save for the housekeeper, and it wasn't even her fault!)\n\nI have to say- SpaSolage and SolBar are not included in this review. They are both still fabulous, and I will continue to head up there for the day to soak in the mineral pool and eat at the restaurant but it'll be a while before I consider staying at the hotel again."}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "My wife and I visited the Solage Calistoga for our honeymoon over the Christmas holiday. What a lovely place! The food is excellent, and the service was wonderful. We were greeted by an incredibly welcoming staff and immediately given the most delicious chai tea I've ever drank (we even got the recipe). We then made our way to our room which was peaceful and cozy; equipped with a fireplace and a large soaking tub that helped us shed any residual wedding planning stress.\n\nIf I could choose one word to describe Solage it would be: serenity. The grounds are peaceful, well maintained, and quiet. The Spa is lovely. We had a couple's massage and then did the mudbath/soaking experience. The resort was crowded for the holidays, but the staff did an excellent job of making your feel cared for by providing what felt like a very individualized experience. I was impressed at how it could really provide for all types of guests: a lesbian couple (us), older couples, families, etc.\n\nAlso, the Mercedes rental program is an interesting perk. We decided to borrow one the vehicles for the day, and while we would not typically partake in something like that we just decided why not?! It was our honeymoon after all! It was fun to drive around Napa Valley in a convertible for the afternoon and live a life that seems only real in movies.\n\nFinally the food. Their restaurant is Michelin rated, so obviously it's really tasty. We had breakfast in the morning as part of out package, and it was delicious. We at dinner their Christmas Day, and it was just superb. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.\n\nBottom Line: While the Solage may be in the more northern part of Napa Valley, we liked having that added privacy. Nothing is too far of a drive, and you can do it in style when borrowing one of the Mercedes. It was a great way for us to experience Napa for the first time! We will most certainly be back!"}, {"Keyword": "something", "Text": "Took my wife here for her babymoon because of the spa and the Michelin restaurant on property. My main goal with the trip was for us to have a relaxing weekend together, let her have some spa time and have delicious food. We just completed the weekend and all was achieved, but found there were hiccups at the spa and restaurant during our stay that could easily have been avoided. Maybe it was a case of bad timing/luck for us during our stay. In the end, we felt relaxed and enjoyed our time (mission accomplished), but left feeling the service we received at the spa and restaurant made us question the level of quality promoted by the resort.\n\n1) Reception - Reception was very welcoming. Offered us chai tea and water. Thanked us for choosing them for our babymoon, confirmed our reservations at the spa, and reviewed the \"Just the Two of Us\" package we purchased. The welcome packet included our spa itineraries which was helpful because we forgot our reservation times.\n2) Room - Our Adara Studio was great. The layout and high ceilings made it feel large and open. The bath products smelled great. My wife enjoyed the bath salts provided when she took a bath. The bed was really comfortable and helped with us feeling relaxed.\n3) Solbar Restaurant - The food here was beyond delicious. Our waiter on our first night was great. He told us highlights about the restaurant and noted its Michelin rating. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The portions were great and frankly more than we expected. We returned for breakfast on day two of babymoon for another delicious meal. The donuts were awesome and softer than pillows used by angels. Dinner on night two was drastically different and very frustrating. We sat in the bar area and our waiter:\na) forgot to put our order in after we waited nearly an hour and asked about the status of our dishes upon seeing two separate groups which arrived after my/our second drink order receive their food orders\nb) repeated our order to him (which he wrote down the first time) and he had to return a minute later to confirm the wrong dish\nc) we asked what could be prepared quickly for us while we waited for our meal to be prepared, he suggested the kale chips, which we ordered and asked to get while we wait\nd) despite our request to bring out dishes one after another and the kale chips before our meal, all three came at the same time\ne) when the waiter described the desserts, it was apparent he didn't know how to properly describe them because what he described was nothing like what I had the night before\nf) I asked for a particular whiskey and once again he had to return a minute later to ask about my order\nThe manager did come over, apologized for the confusion of the evening and made the situation right.\n4) Spa Solage - We arrived for our 50 minute Couples Massage spa appointment early as requested, my wife confirmed with the hostess her prenatal massage, and we were given a quick tour. As it turns out my masseur had my appointment time 15 minutes earlier and my wife's masseur arrived for her 15 minutes later than our same scheduled times. I'm not a massage person (1 every 8 years), but I thought our Couples Massage meant we would be in a room together. As it turns out we were in separate rooms. I could have said something, but I was under the impression my wife had already been was whisked away to her massage. After our massages we met by the heated pool, had a snack and a smoothie for a snack before our mudslide. My wife informed of the delay with her appointment, that her massage was actually a little more that 30 minutes, and that when walking to her massage room she mentioned to her masseur about her prenatal massage. This news was a surprise to him and he had to get more pillows. Afterwards we did the spas Mudslide experience which was very relaxing. Each stage of the experience just took us one step closer to relaxation. So much so that we returned to the room and my wife took an hour nap.\n5) Other Stuff - Rooms come with two bikes each which was fun. Unfortunately because of the rain we couldn't have our typical cut-throat bocce contest."}, {"Keyword": "soothing", "Text": "I stayed at Solage for 3 nights Sept 17-20 during \"wine crush\" season. This was my first trip to the Napa wine country and boy did we choose right! Calistoga is a few towns north of Napa and known for it's geothermal waters. Solage occupies a beautiful parcel only 15 minutes from St Helena, but feels a world away. They have a beautiful pool, gorgeous restaurant (indoor and outdoor), and a first-class spa offering unique treatments.\n\nThe suites are bungalow style and very spacious (around 800 sq ft) with utmost privacy. Your room comes with cruiser bikes to use during your stay and we took advantage of them - riding into town and to several fantastic wineries nearby.\n\nBreakfast was included in our rate, and you could have it either in the restaurant or brought to your room. The food was fantastic - fresh, delicious, and innovative.\n\nTheir spa facility is gorgeous: with all-white relaxation rooms, a coed geothermal pool, and individual male/female hot tub areas where clothing is optional. We opted for their \"couples mudslide treatment\" which was different than anything I have ever experienced at a hotel spa. you are brought into a tiled room, with private patio where you spread scented volcanic ash mud on your body. You rest for 20 minutes in warm heat as it dries, then are transferred to a private room with oversized soaking tubs where you relax in the geothermal water. The final step is the \"rest room\" where you are placed in a zero-gravity lounge chair, wrapped in down blanket, and given headphones for soothing music. You nap there for 20 minutes. Absolute heaven!\n\nThe Calistoga wineries nearby are fantastic. We rode bikes to Chateau Montelena, Vincent Arroyo, Lava Fire, and Laura Michaels. There are many more just a short drive into St. Helena. If you are looking for sublime relaxation, great food, in a beautiful chill environment - this place is for you!"}, {"Keyword": "soothing", "Text": "This place is spectacular! Accommodations are private and very nice with all the amenities you would expect (an expensive place to stay however). All of the staff was very helpful and my wife and I enjoyed all of the spa activities including couples mudbaths, which we highly recommend. We added 3 days to our initial stay because we enjoying the relaxing soothing atmosphere. Go there for a wonderful rejuvenation."}, {"Keyword": "soothing", "Text": "This place is like a slice of heaven. The rooms are every simple, but elegant and soothing. I like that they have two bikes by your front door so you can take off exploring the grounds, or go less than one Mile to the cute downtown of Calistoga. I couldn't leave without buying a bottle of the cleanser and lotion. The geo-thermal pool was wonderful. The big pool was also great, but beware if you do laps it's long!!!! It's almost Olympic size."}, {"Keyword": "soothing", "Text": "Nicely appointed individual cottages, with sufficient distance and arranged to feel very independent, yet close enough not to feel too lonely. Great beds, spacious rooms, and great food (One Star Michelin), and nice spa with a really soothing hot, mineral water pool. 2 bicycles included with each room. Well appointed Gym, with some training included. The town and vineyards, close by and safe to ride the bikes."}, {"Keyword": "soothing", "Text": "Just returned from a glorious long weekend at Solage, and our cross country trip and 2-hour drive from SFO was well worth the effort. The grounds are lovely and thoughtfully landscaped. Our room was spotless, relaxing and so well appointed that we didn't mind whiling away a rainy afternoon inside. Once outdoors, we adored the well situated and pristine Olympic-length pool for peaceful exercise, and the spa for soothing treatment. And the service! We were literally pondering a need for additional creamer for the next day's coffee when we heard a gentle knock on the door. Outside, a staffer stood with creamer. The staff was friendly, professional and focused on our needs. I yearn to return!"}]
