5,Hard to beat getaway location...,"I only stayed the one night with my family at Solage, but it was perfect in every way. Rooms are super-spacious and very well equipped. Everything worked, including WiFi - staff went way and beyond to do everything possible to make our stay memorable, and for all the right reasons. If you find the need to get away and decompress, or catch up on life, then you'll find Solace hard to beat.",
5,Paradise in Calistoga!!!,"Returned from the most amazing trip to Napa area. The Solage could not have been a better place for girls trip. Everything was absolutely perfect!! Stayed in the Silverado suite and was completely happy with everything about the room. Room was very comfortable and had large spacious bathroom with plenty of closet space. The grounds are meticulously kept and the entire resort has such a relaxed feel. Let me give a big thumbs up to the entire staff who were all so friendly and helpful - they all really make you feel welcome and special. Want to give a special thanks to Joe the Director of Operations who could not have been more helpful and pleasant - he really put our stay over the top!!!

While at the resort we took a few of the many fitness classes offered which was such a wonderful treat and the classes were great. We also utilized the gym which was perfectly equipped and allowed us to not miss a workout. The resort is also so close to hiking trails which was a great way to start our mornings - you can take the bikes from your room right to trails.

Now let's talk about the spa..... OMG had weekday sampler treatment and it was probably the best treatment I have ever had ( And I am definitely a spa enthusiast)!! The whole experience was top notch. The treatment rooms were clean, beautiful and just a tranquil, relaxing experience.

My only complaint and its not really a complaint is I was not happy with menu at Solbar they had very limited options especially for vegetarians and there was no good lunch options for my group. Michael the Solbar manager was an absolute angel and was able to help up get a meal that we were so happy with on our day of arrival when we were absolutely starving! Just another example of how fantastic the staff at the Solage is.

I will be definitely be returning to the Solage next year - just need to now figure out a way to stay longer because this place is really a relaxing paradise.",
5,"Pretty resort, comfortable luxe room","We were so happy to arrive and find extremely comfortable beds after two nights on the coast at another hotel with uncomfortable beds. The spacious room was immaculate, as you would expect at this price, as was the service. Reception was welcoming, offering us a glass of wine at check in, and a few things requested from housekeeping and room service arrived very promptly. We took advantage of a car offered for guest use (my husband is a car fanatic and could not resist) and went a few miles down the road to our favorite place in Yountville for some fresh oysters. We had a late dinner reservation (830 is late for us) at Solbar as that was all that was available but it worked out fine after our later afternoon snack. Dinner at Solbar was a treat. We can't wait to go back and stay longer.",
5,Unmatched Customer Service and Care,"There is no place in the world that I have traveled where I get quite this level of service, care and responsiveness. I keep coming back because this place knows how to treat you. From the 3 menu's to choose from, the 3 pools, the killer customer service that know you by NAME... it is like coming home - but to a home you never had!",
5,A wonderful stay!,We stayed at Solage to celebrate my husband’s birthday with our dog. It was a wonderful experience. Every detail was well done and we cannot wait to return! We had a fabulous experience at the spa and a beautiful meal at Solbar.,
5,"Solage=Bliss. Don't think, just book and go","We just returned from 2 nights at Solage and are still feeling the effects. The service is impeccable, personal, thoughtful and just the right amount of attention. We were celebrating a special occasion and there were special touch points during our stay where staff made an effort to commemorate and note the occasion. We were surprised more than once with these personal touches and it was so appreciated. We never left the property and enjoyed 4 luxury spa appointments and ate every meal on-site, so.I can assure the exquisite service extends to every facet of the resort. The details are what you really notice and you will be surprised and delighted by these during your stay----walking along the path to your room and you pass by a hot apple cider bar, with candied ginger and cinnamon sticks. A fresh bottle of water delivered to your room for turndown. A beautiful piece of chocolate on a lovely ceramic dish by your bedside. Oh, and the robes provided in your room feel like you are wrapping yourself in a fluffy cloud. The linens are equally as sublime and the bed, good god, the bed is amazing. The rooms themselves are perfectly designed and feel private, spacious and every last want or need in a hotel stay is not overlooked. In short, go. You will become a lifetime fan of this resort without a doubt. We are coming back next month and I've got the date circled on my virtual calendar!",
5,Worthwhile Stay,"Relaxing locale, delicious food, unbelievable staff, cozy suites with beds a mixture of a cloud and a hug, remarkable spa and just an all-around phenomenal atmosphere... Solbar definitely met all our dining needs from formal dinner, to breakfast outside, to an afternoon snack and cocktail to in-room dining- it was perfect! The Bathhouse was amazing and Marina made our experience even better!",
5,Perfect weekend getaway!,"My husband and I decided to drive 2 hrs to Calistoga for a weekend of R & R and Solage had everything we were looking for. Beautiful resort, with a spa and restaurant, friendly staff, lovely room, comfy bed, and plush, warm robes for the cool Calistoga morning. Pure relaxation.

We enjoyed the Spa prior to checking in. We enjoyed an amazing couples massage from Cindy and Rebecca. We then headed over to the geothermal pool and enjoyed some delicious fish tacos from Solbar while waiting to check-in. Fortunately, the resort was able to accommodate an early check-in. Thank you front desk!

Our dinner at Solbar was delicious. We had the pulled burrata, steelhead salmon, and grilled pork chop. We were initially told that we would be placed on a waitlist since there weren't any reservations available, but we walked over to Solbar around 6pm and were seated immediately. Our server, Laura, was outstanding!

We didn't make use of the bikes outside of our room, but had we stayed an another night, I would have definitely explored the resort on bike. Solage is a little on the pricey side, but in the end, we found it to be worth every penny.",
5,Girls weekend,Fantastic stay at Solage will Be back again soon. I’ve been here many times before and is certainly my favorite get away place. The pools and spa are clean. Love the food and service at Solage. Will be back soon,
5,Worth every penny,"This was a special trip for us and it did not disappoint. The staff was friendly, the property gorgeous, and the food was fantastic. The spa experience was clean, relaxing and stress-free. It was worth every penny and I would do it again if I could!",
5,Extraordinary world class resort,"The most magical place in California. A must for anyone that’s traveling to Napa Valley and Calistoga. I highly recommend this resort. The service is impeccable, dinning is fabulous, and the service is unforgettable.",
5,Peaceful Elegance with superb food and service,"We had such a great relaxing escape at Solage. Our room was very comfortable and with a view. The patio outside faces trees and park like area for the kids and/or pets to play. Inside the bedding is wonderful, the Nespresso coffee & tea machine is a real treat. The towels are large and lush which match the bedding and robes. To top it off, we were greeted with a wine and fruit tray accompanied by a nice welcome card. We will be coming back.",
5,"Wonderful Staff, beautiful resort","Almost everything about this resort is 5 stars. The beds are extremely comfortable, the pillows are probably the best we have ever had at any luxury hotel and the staff is very nice and accommodating. There were only a few items I would change or fix. The heating system is very difficult to operate. You have to use your room key and the system does not remember your own personal setting for very long. It will revert back to the preset temp of 72 in the middle of the night and then it does get a bit warm. I had to wake up numerous times in the middle of the night to readjust it. Our trash we left on the counter wasn't cleaned up each day. We left dishes for them to clean but they didn't remove them. I would also provide two hands instead of one for both sinks. Everything else was just wonderful!! We will definitely stay again and try all of the other amazing amenities the resort offers when the weather is warmer. The room service food isn't as good as the restaurant. For the price, I would say just go to eat at the restaurant for breakfast instead of room service. Overall we loved our stay. Just a few small items they could do differently or fix.",
5,complete luxury,"we stayed to celebrate 3 birthdays. The staff at the solage were so thoughtful. We were greeted with chocolate chip cookies, milk, wine and a fruit bowl and card wishing us happy birthday. in the crib was a tiny stuffed animal with a solage t-shirt for our baby, sunblock and wipes. the attitude and service of the staff were incredible. everyone was incredibly polite, friendly and thoughtful. We loved the trip and will be back! we've stayed at many nice resorts and Solage is our favorite.",
5,Relaxation at its finest,"We were blown away by the beauty of the property, the luxury of the amenities (the mattress! the sheets! the pillows! the duvet! the towels! etc!), the courtesy of the staff, the quality of the food, the relaxation in the mineral pool, and the list goes on and on. We had a wonderful time.",
5,Luxury at its finest,"I write this review truly pleased. As a person also in the customer service business I know things are supposed to go right every time at least the customer facing things. But I also know that just isn't true every time.

I had what ill call a series of pretty severe missteps in my experience here. But I can say with certainty the people in charge of righting those wrongs stepped up and did. Over the top in fact.

If you are looking for some surface level reviews where people tell they had a good time most of the time you'll find them here as well, but I am here to tell you that when things go wrong (and we all know they do now and then) this is a facility, and a staff that will do everything it can to make sure they fix it. Nice job Solage team. Keep it up and I'll see you next time I'm looking for a relaxing stay.

High end place, top notch staff, top notch amenities. The spa deserves its own 5-star review as well!",
5,Winter Perfection,"A lovely resort, especially soaking in the natural hot springs as the rain poured down. There were plenty of large and warm towels awaiting us. Then into the spa for a steam, and a shower with all the amenities including comfortable bathrobes. The swim in the olympic pool, that i had entirely on my own, was another highlight. All of the food was delicious. Friendly staff, but not too friendly; so our privacy was preserved. Rosemary is all over the property which smelled great in the rain.",
5,Luxury in the midst of a storm,"Our reservation date landed in the midst of a storm. We thought about cancelling our trip, but so happy we didn't! Solage was a luxurious oasis in the middle of the storm. They did everything to make our stay warm and comfortable despite the inclement weather. They provided cabanas in the spa pool area, had transportation to take us to and from our room to the spa, etc. The staff was top notch and we enjoyed every minute of our stay.",
5,Doesn't Get More Personalized Than Solage,"Solage is a high end boutique resort that excels in everything they do. The property is very clean and elegant. You won't find a piece of trash anywhere. The staff are exceptional and don't change over the years. Management must be treating their staff well. There are multiple warm pools, a Michelin star restaraunt on site that's casual and many amenities. I am suprised they don't charge closer to $800 a night for a room. Solage is a Gem.",
4,"Another great stay at Solage, your Napa Dog Friendly location!","Solage is our ""go to"" location in the Napa Valley for a dog friendly getaway; probably the *best* dog friendly hotel in the whole area, we go there regularly with our two 60lb shepherd and collie.

The Silverado Suite, while the most expensive, is ideal for your furry companions, since unlike all the other room types, the ""back yard"" of the suite is fully enclosed thus you can let your dogs ""off leash"" in the room, and allow them to roam around the ""back yard"" as they please.

As for dining, you can sit outdoors at Solbar with your dog, or if you like take a 15 minute walk into Calistoga itself and sit outside at the wonderful Evangeline's.

Solage charges $100 per visit as a pet fee, which includes beds, bowls, treats and poop bags, which are also available around the resort itself...

We cannot recommend this place too highly for those of you who want to enjoy Napa
(well Calistoga) with your beloved dogs in tow!",
5,Perfect getaway – amazing food and resort!,You can't go wrong with the Solage! Bed and linens are super comfortable. Food is delicious. Property is beautiful and the spa/pool is absolutely relaxing! Make sure to book your spa appointments and dinner reservations early.,
5,"Solage in Calistoga, perfect getaway!","Amazing, unpretentious and completely pampered experience at Solage in Calistoga!! From the room to the facilities and especially the mineral pools amd spa!! Would go back and I will, in a heartbeat! So needed and frlt completely refreshed!! Thank you Solage!",
5,A week at Solage,"Excellent location, staff, services and amenities. Our 4th visit and we will return for the next Christmas week. Of particular importance to me was the friendliness and acuity of staff in every department.",
5,A girls celebration,"Solage is an awesome hotel. A glass of wine when u arrival. A bottle of wine, nespresso coffee and a fridge full of drinks! Exercise classes outstanding. Yoga everyday! So quiet and peaceful! Worth every penny!",
5,The ultimate in comfortable luxury,"A recent weekend trip to Solage to celebrate a birthday was prompted by a special ""Get back to Napa"" offer following the recent firestorm in the area. It couldn't have been more relaxing -- the studio was spacious and private, the amenities excellent, and no detail had been overlooked to make our stay magical. Even the dog was happy with the special bed and treats that welcomed him at check in. The room was so comfortable that we had most of our meals through Room Service, including some killer butterscotch pudding made with Macallan 18. One day we walked into Calistoga, a 20 minute stroll from which we returned with shoes and books: what could be better?",
5,"Great Service, Amenities and Rooms","Solage is an amazing property. It's in the heart of the Wine Country, surrounded by vineyards and mountains. The studios are chic and modern. The restaurant is first-class and so are the thermal pools and the spa. But nothing tops Solage's swimming pool -- it's over 120 feet long and framed by majestic palm trees and olive trees.",
5,Dream resort,"The solage is one of the best places we’ve stayed. The rooms are elegant with excellent coffee, the most comfortable robes and a great shower. There is also a fully stocked mini bar and the most excellent chocolates for turndown service. Rooms come with bikes and it is also walking distance to downtown Calistoga. The solbar offered great drinks onsite with a great outside patio with fire pit. We didn’t have time to try the pool or spa but both looked amazing.",
5,A relaxing spa birthday getaway,"Been wanting too visit wine country for my birthday and searched for a nice resort with spa services and excellent food. So happy that we stayed at the Solage because the experience was excellent! From the staff, private suites, complimentary rental, layout of the property, food, bar, restaurant, and spa exceeded my expectations, The mudbath spa treatment was so relaxing and rejuvenating. Will definately be coming back again,",
5,Perfect getaway,"Spent a night at solage for my birthday. Can’t recommend it highly enough. Property was beautiful, geothermal pools were incredible, restaurant was excellent and staff was so kind. All in all a really wonderful stay in the awesome town of Calistoga. Go and support wine country!",
5,WOW! What a hotel & spa!!!,"This was one of the most serene and high quality hotels I’ve visited in America. It lived up to and exceeded its reputation. Everything was A+++

We stayed in a king studio. It was spacious and in great condition. Very cool shower set up: I think it was made of some type of rock. I hadn’t seen one like that before.

Spa was awesome even in the middle of winter. Mud slide was cool, and definitely worth getting the longer one as even that felt quick. I wish I could buy the relaxation chair.

Food was phenomenal, both the included room service breakfast and also the 5-Star Napa restaurant.

We need an excuse to come back!!!!",
5,SO MUCH LOVE!!!,"This was our second stay at Solage, and it was even more amazing than I remembered. The service level is impeccable. Staff is courteous, the grounds are gorgeous, the beds are beyond comfortable. The food was excellent. They had chai outside during the day, which I just loved. I can’t say enough great things. We also both had massages at the spa, and picked up some great/cute items from the shop in the spa. Might have gone a little overboard, but such great stuff! Will remember this as one of the best trips of my life. Thanks Solage!",
5,Lovely respite from the world in the heart of wine country,"Calistoga is a little further north than much of the Napa Valley, so it's a little more quiet and less crowded up here. The placid, tree-lined grounds are welcoming and encourage guests to take a stroll, but each room also gets two bikes to pedal about if you prefer. (Pump up the tires at the bell desk, though.) The friendly staff will make every point of your visit enjoyable. I've stayed here several times and always liked it. There's a huge swimming pool I didn't swim in (but wished I had) and the food in the restaurant is first class. It's a luxury hotel so you're looking at around $500 a night but compared to other similar hotels up here - most of which are also nice - it's worth it. I would have designed the room a little differently to be more open and I might have chosen an interior color different from the institutional green they have, but that's really nitpicking. This is a lovely part of California and this hotel is a nice base from which to explore it. I would go back again without hesitation, and probably will soon.",
5,Luxe Without The Attitude,"Beautiful place for a relaxing Saturday in the sun. Many spas like this are a bit snooty but not Solage. Great vibe, excellent service and the food and bev were on point. The shrimp lettuce wraps were delicious as was the rose' that washed them down. We'll be back.",
5,Endless Relaxation,"Solage is always the perfect place for a relaxing getaway, there is nothing better than breakfast at Solbar, relaxing at the spa, and enjoying the geo-thermal mineral waters. You will surely leave rejuvenated.",
5,Relaxing and restorative,"This was our third time at Solage and the place never disappoints. It has a tranquility about it that allows you to completely relax and everything is set up for maximum ease and comfort. The lap pool is fantastic, whether you actually want to swim laps or just lounge next to it, and the spa facilities provide everything you need to unwind completely.",
5,Great place to stay,"We love Solage. The property is beautiful. It has all the things we look for - spa, exercise, awesome restaurant. All the staff is friendly and inviting. The room was modern with a soaking tub and steam shower, we had a semi-private patio.",
5,Great honeymoon escape,"The staff is exceptional, as are the grounds, and the on-site restaurant, Solbar. We spent 1 entire day at the spa, and loved every second of it. The concierge set us up very nicely with great ideas of things to do. Very happy. Only downside is this place is a bit pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.",
5,1st Class all the way!!!,"This was such a treat! The Spirit of Napa special made it possible for my girlfriend and I to have a wonderful two days in the wine country. The resort is absolutely gorgeous. Each studio is tucked away with it's own private porch. We had a view of a beautiful, majestic oak tree. We were welcomed with a glass of wine and a smile!! The rooms are very large, bed comfortable, double sinks, Nespesso machine, fresh half and half, turn down service, robes, and a wonderful spa...we spent a rainy afternoon in the two hot pools, steam room and reading area. Highly recommend this place!!",
5,We loved this gorgeous resort! Two Michelin Star Restaurant Solbar was loved as well! We'll be back!<3,"Not long after the October 2017 fires that devastated Napa and Sonoma, we still wanted to visit and enjoy our previously planned wine country vacation. We arrived at Solage and were very happy with what we saw......a beautiful resort with a spa and an amazing restaurant. Upon our arrival, the offered to pour us a splash of wine at check-in. We arrived a bit early so they suggested we have lunch at their restaurant, Solbar. We didn't know at the time what a great suggestion that was! We sat and looked at the beautiful surrounding at this restaurant...the outside, the inside......it was all so impressive! Then the friendly and helpful service from the waitstaff! It only got better because then there was the beautiful food! OMG! We shared the tuna sliders and a few other appetizers! We didn't even eat that much but because it all tasted so delicious that we were satisfied and very happy! They poured us a delicious and complimentary glass of sparkling wine. Not long after our beautiful room was ready. Clean, updated, large and comfortable. Bicycles for our use outside were a nice touch. So, we ate three meals in a row at Solbar! Two Michelin stars! Every meal better than the one before! If anyone is wondering if it's time to go back to the wine country......go now! Before it gets too crowded again....all wineries are open and happy to have you. Solage was one of the best hotels we've ever been to. It's part of the Auberge collection. An elegant-hip place to be....one of the best in Napa! Hurry and go!!!!!",
5,Grand Experience,"What a wonderful place to stay! Breathtaking views, rooms are studios so you have personal space. The SPA is wonderful. The food is phenomenal. The service is white-glove and the optional Mercedes Benz program use is a wonderful addition. You truly get what you pay for here!",
5,Chic high class yet casual getaway,Loved this place! We’ve always stayed down valley while visiting Napa Valley. This trip we decided to go north and found the Solage. This place offers a casual chic vibe with super nice cottages. The fitness area and outdoor pools were great as we were able to get a workout in everyday before starting our wine tasting. The staff was super friendly and really have zero complaints. We will be back.,
5,"Kid AND dog/puppy friendly, in the wine country?!? Yes!","Six years ago I went looking for a peaceful retreat where my husband, who had just had a heart attack, and our 5 year old daughter could celebrate his life and his turning 50. That was six years ago and we go back to Solage every chance we get. Finally we had found a place in the wine country where we didn't feel like we had to apologize for wanting our young daughter along. It felt like a miracle. Then, last spring we rescued a puppy, Larry. We already had our Solage get-a-way planned with friends, so we thought, okay, they say we can bring dogs! So we brought our 11 week old rescue along for the ride. Solage was AMAZING! Not only did they welcome us and our friends, but Larry was enthusiastically welcomed by every single person who worked there. If you're looking for a first class get-a-way in the wine country to celebrate friends, family (yes, that includes our dogs) and life, where you are welcomed into a world of relaxation, book Solage in Calistoga. You won't be disappointed.",
5,"Amazing property, superb service and great time to visit!!","Nestled in a quiet area walking distance to Calistoga my wife and I returned to Solage, an amazing place to relax, enjoy its well known spa and their incredible pool. No matter what we did, we enjoyed the place with its outstanding service and food.

My wife and I hesitated driving to Calistoga due to the recent fires. The truth is that, even though the city was evacuated, it was all a precautionary move as one cannot see any damage at all from Solage nor the town. We were greeted by beautiful sunny days and spectacular views of the grapes turning to their fall colors. This site is almost as beautiful as visiting the fall back East.",
4,3rd time back..always nice..but not sure about next time..,"Don't mean to contradict my previous review - but been back to Solage again in August 2017 (this being our 3rd time) and felt the hotel was a little dated. Service at the breakfast wasn't as good as I remembered it to be.
As we had stayed at a brand new hotel for the first 2 nights, coming back to Solage on the 3rd night made me feel like I wouldn't want to come back again.

The breakfast area wasn't even that busy, but seemed to take forever to get served. I ordered oatmeal for breakfast but when I asked for milk for the oatmeal, it took 3 tries before I got anything.

Had a spa treatment at the last minute. The spa was good and relaxing - as you would expect from a 5* hotel. I wouldn't say it is the best, but was good enough a treat on a holiday. Something you would expect when you pay high prices and service charge for.",
5,A Great Place to Relax,"This is our favorite type of hotel: One that is set on spacious attractive grounds with individual cottages and plenty of amenities to keep you happy without having to leave the property.

Our cottage was charming on the outside with modern décor on the inside. The look was simple, almost bland, but to a high standard and included two leather chairs looking out to the patio. The bathroom was spacious with a walk-in shower and separate water closet. Our only complaint about the room was the lack of good storage space especially drawers. We were staying for four nights and it would have been nice to have been able to unpack some more and not live out of a suitcase, especially at this price point. Neither of our bags fit in the limited closet, but the cottage was a bit bigger than expected. The room also had nice lighting and we really enjoyed having a big sliding door out to a semi private patio with two chairs, a table, and a pretty view of the property. We liked our placement in the main area of the resort (1-50) where the grounds are manicured and green. Cottages away from this area (51-89) have a more rustic setting.

If you want to pull yourself away from relaxing on the patio then where should you go? The spa complex at this hotel is very nice, with a chic country modern look with full amenities besides treatments such as a spa pool, and separate water areas for men and women. There are also exercise classes on site and a light filled large gym where you can get a full workout. Time at the pool is also a must. It is very large with a beautiful view of the nearby hills. A separate kid’s pool keeps everyone happy and separate. And you might as well take the bikes that come with your cottage for a spin. Or maybe you would prefer more stylish transportation and borrow one of the hotel’s Mercedes.

The only area of the hotel that did not work for us was the much lauded hotel restaurant Solbar. It is a very attractive space inside and out, but the menu was way too fancy for our taste buds, even for breakfast. We did take advantage of the Auberge connection to get us in for a wonderful breakfast at their sister property Calistoga Ranch which is otherwise not open to the public for meals, and also a breakfast at Auberge du Soleil.

The location of the hotel is great at the quieter northern end of the valley but close enough to the other areas not to make it inconvenient. Downtown Calistoga is minutes away via any form of transportation. It is a charming town with a nice collection of eclectic stores and lots of restaurants.

Solage has a great setup and setting and with so much to offer, it is the perfect place to hang your hat for a few days.",
5,Fantastic Resort in Napa,My husband and I thought Solage was lovely. The food was excellent. The spa and mineral baths were very relaxing and we were able to access the baths even when we were not using the spa. We enjoyed access to the Mercedes-Benz vehicles during out stay and they also helped us easily arrange car service back to the airport. Having the bikes available was an easy way to get around. It made me think to try an Auberge Resort in a different destination or come back here with my family.,
5,Tranquility,"Quiet, peaceful, amazing amenities, ideal location (hiking and biking, bikes provided), delicious bath products, the most comfortable beds and robes ever! They even have cars you can use! Full service spa and gym with all the classes you would expect and more.",
3,Average to good experience for the pricey stay,"This is about the third or fourth time we have stayed at Solage. The prices have gone up big time and I feel the service has declined a bit.
We checked in and the girl helping us didn't seem very tenured or experienced in the hospitality business. If I wanted to I probably could have made her cry and want to quit but the yogi in me refrained. We asked for a tub in our room and she said they were committed and couldn't upgrade us. Since when is a tub an upgrade?! I literally saw about two or three other couples or the same folks the next two days. They were not booked solid as we were there Sun-Wed. I feel like we were lied to.

Service around the pools was fine and the staff nice, but for a resort of this caliber there should be more. The wine in the cans offered tasted very bad. The food was very overpriced. The lounge chairs are not padded and somewhat uncomfortable. We hung out at the pool and used the gym and steam/sauna rooms often. I took 3 yoga classes. Two of the classes by Deanne were great although we didn't do much ""flow or warrior poses"". The other teacher Urlika didn't really teach yoga but more like a sports stretching class dubbed as ""therapeutic yoga"". I was expecting more of a yin or restorative type. Nonetheless I enjoyed the classes and the yoga room is beautiful. All the equipment is great.

The room: We love the room and outdoor patio. It's rustic, modern and spacious. The bed is comfy but pillows to mushy. I asked for a thicker pillow but the one they brought was too stiff and high. They could use a pillow bar with the prices they charge. We love the nespresso machine although its noisy in the morning when your partner is sleeping. There is coffee outside the front desk which is nice to have. We were able to picnic outside our room with wine and cheese. The staff brought us ice right away. The bikes could use some maintenance. Mine had a low tire and both were very dusty. These should be in tip top shape when paying close to $700 a night! I will say the hotel needs to spray for bugs a bit more. I saw spiders and a roach or something crawling on the floor as we were checking out. I have seen other reviews about ants but we didn't have that problem.

Solbar: We ate here but only had the bar menu and sat on the other side of the main restaurant but outdoors. The hostess said the main restaurant was full although I saw many empty tables. The burger was great but the plate could have better presentation for $20. Thought the fries could be thicker and more home made like. Service was pretty good. The rest of the portions seemed to be small. We shared the cheesecake for dessert and that was large and fantastic.

Our room rate included breakfast and I thought the food was really good. Fresh and quality ingredients. The donuts were fabulous at the end. Coffee was tasty too. We both had omelets, regular and egg whites with goat cheese and spinach. I think we enjoyed lounging at breakfast the most. Although our waiter bailed on us and went on break without telling us. Kept us waiting on the check and our last minute donut order.

Pro's:
So close to Calistoga. Fun to ride the bikes into town. Great market in town as well to buy cheese and bread. Near some fun wineries and off the Silverado trail.
Loved the grounds, pools, spa amenities, etc. The cottages are very private and all have small outdoor spaces to lounge; great for the hotter months. Loved the in room coffee and drinks. Turndown service is a nice touch with chocolate and water. The gym and yoga studio is very nice.
The valet and check in staff was nice. The welcome wine is a good touch but they should include a bottle in the room as well.
When we did call for extra pillows, ice etc. there was prompt service and delivery!

Things they can work on:
Weeks before I emailed concierge to ask for a list of wineries they recommend. I was expecting something tailored and unique. Instead they sent pdfs of the entire region. Not really custom and didn't offer to help with creating an itinerary or reservations. I was expecting a little more service here.

Upon check in the front desk staff thanked us for our multiple stays but it would be a nice gesture to send something like wine, champagne or snacks to the room for our loyalty.

The staff was very nice but no one went out of their way. Something you would expect paying $700 a night.

On multiple occasions the staff asked for our last name (esp at Solbar) and then only addressed my husband as Mr. (our last name) and not me. I thought this was a bit old school.

There should be snacks and hot drinks in the spa waiting area.

Overall a nice and enjoyable stay but we are thinking of trying other spots nearby on our next jaunt!",
5,Solage Calistoga,A beautiful resort that exceeded our expectations. We were celebrating our 20th anniversary and couldn’t be happier with our experience here. The spa was fabulous. The nicest I’ve ever been to. I would definitely recommend this place and can’t wait to stay here again.,
5,Unwind in style,"All around wonderful experience. We used all the amenities, including a couple's massage and dinner at the restaurant. During our two night stay there really wasn't a reason to leave the resort. The resort was sold out, yet it never appeared crowded. All staff were polite and professional. It was an extremely relaxing experience. We highly recommend.",
5,Simple heaven on earth,"This is a simply splendid resort in almost every way. If you like to swim, it is a must as their pool is marvelous--to float there and look up and see only undeveloped hills that contain this beautiful valley is magical. To sit by the pool all day, ordering drinks and lunch when you feel like it is also a perfect way to spend the day.",
5,Heaven in napa,I have never been more satisfied was a stay! Every thing was perfect from the fabulous bed and pillows to the tremendous food to the huge pool and topped off with the Mercedes convertible you can use for four hours. We enjoyed every minute here and hated to leave.,
5,Anniversary trip,"Solage was incredible in every way
We had a fantastic meal (that we left to the chef )at Solbar for our anniversary
We are world travelers and have eaten at Several Michelin star restaurants including the French Laundry, Solbar in our opinion was a notch above.
The resort staff was attentive and pleasant, the therapeutic pool and area was relaxing, yoga Classes instruction
Knowledgeable and experienced.
Our room , no need to upgrade was comfortable and well equipped, we enjoyed coffee on our patio every morning.
Did a mudslide treatment at the spa, recommended.
We will be back and stay again at Solage.
We have stayed at many more $$$$$*****places in wine country over the years ,Solage really suits our personalities and style.. laid back Luxury.",
5,Ultimate Relaxation,"We live an hours drive away. Solage is the most luxurious & relaxing weekend within driving distance from our home. For three days & nights we rarely ventured off the property, as Sol Bar is one of our favorite restaurants in the greater Bay area...Hiking, pool, & food. Perfect!",
5,"Fantastic Calistoga spa/resort: chic, spacious and very chill!","I stayed at Solage for 3 nights Sept 17-20 during ""wine crush"" season. This was my first trip to the Napa wine country and boy did we choose right! Calistoga is a few towns north of Napa and known for it's geothermal waters. Solage occupies a beautiful parcel only 15 minutes from St Helena, but feels a world away. They have a beautiful pool, gorgeous restaurant (indoor and outdoor), and a first-class spa offering unique treatments.

The suites are bungalow style and very spacious (around 800 sq ft) with utmost privacy. Your room comes with cruiser bikes to use during your stay and we took advantage of them - riding into town and to several fantastic wineries nearby.

Breakfast was included in our rate, and you could have it either in the restaurant or brought to your room. The food was fantastic - fresh, delicious, and innovative.

Their spa facility is gorgeous: with all-white relaxation rooms, a coed geothermal pool, and individual male/female hot tub areas where clothing is optional. We opted for their ""couples mudslide treatment"" which was different than anything I have ever experienced at a hotel spa. you are brought into a tiled room, with private patio where you spread scented volcanic ash mud on your body. You rest for 20 minutes in warm heat as it dries, then are transferred to a private room with oversized soaking tubs where you relax in the geothermal water. The final step is the ""rest room"" where you are placed in a zero-gravity lounge chair, wrapped in down blanket, and given headphones for soothing music. You nap there for 20 minutes. Absolute heaven!

The Calistoga wineries nearby are fantastic. We rode bikes to Chateau Montelena, Vincent Arroyo, Lava Fire, and Laura Michaels. There are many more just a short drive into St. Helena. If you are looking for sublime relaxation, great food, in a beautiful chill environment - this place is for you!",
5,Perfect.,"From the moment we arrived, everything was beyond our expectations. We were hoping it would be worth the high price...and it was! Service was amazing. I could have eaten at the restaurant for every meal. The spa is beautiful and luxurious. The fitness center and yoga classes are first class. They even have Mercedes available for the guests to use. I could go on and on....wine upon arrival, excellent room service, bocce courts, wonderful complimentary teas and coffee. We will be coming back for sure!",
5,Elopement,"The process is effortless, Kristin and Sarah kept us on track and on top of things. The wedding day is perfect, everything is taken care and I got to enjoy our wedding 100%. Love our overall experience at Solage.",
5,A dream Hotel,"Excellent service, reserved luxury. Almost everything is perfect. A relaxing and outstanding weekend. The pool is perfect, the Mercedes service is a treat and the overall experience is that someone really cares for you.",
5,You do pay but you do get!,"A truly relaxing, beautiful spa, mineral pools, swimming pool, fitness center, awesome! Very nice and comfortable rooms and overall really great service. Very pricey restaurant, didn't eat dinner, but breakfast seemed very overpriced for what we got in our opinion. But the views were beautiful and the place is relaxing-be aware though, that during racing season as it is now (Sept), you can really, I mean really, hear the racing til about 9:30-10:00 pm in your studio/cottage on Friday and Saturday nights...",
5,Heaven!,"Every moment of the stay here was sublime.
Friendly, personal check in, understated villa with the most comfortable beds, well stocked and complimentary mini bar, swimming pool long enough to swim in or mineral baths to soak in. Truly fantastic.
And if this is not enough a Mercedes you can borrow when tired of the free bikes.
Setting is perfect, plenty of vineyards to visit.
Not cheap but sometimes you deserve a little bit of heaven.",
4,Mudslide Treatment,"This review is specifically for the mudslide treatment at Spa Solage only. I booked this treatment as a surprise for my husband. We did the midweek special which waives the ""resort fee"" and since part of the service did feel short, I did not feel cheated. First you go into a room and paint mud on each other. I felt we had sufficient time here and when the attendant knocked on the door to shower they gave us plenty of time to do both. Where we lost out on time was someone forgot to fill our side by side tubs for our dual mineral bath so they moved us to gravity chairs instead, which is the reverse order they advertise. We fell asleep on the gravity chairs, so i have mixed feelings if this mixup affected our experience since we did still enjoy it all. Where we did feel somewhat cheated is that our mineral bath was only 10 minutes now. So we got in, relaxed, and then it was followed by a quick knock on the door service was done. All and in all I would do it again but on the midweek special rate you feel that it was worth it then. All the staff was very pleasant by the way, no issues there, and the spa waiting area was restful and felt like we had it all to ourselves.",
4,Don't look.,"The staff when we arrived were helpful and made us feel wanted. Or room was not ready, it always makes me nervous when that happens . I think there should be a comfort lounge or something or a bar. Anyway we sat buy the pool in our traveling clothes and eventually we were shown to our bungalow. The bed was centered in the room with exits to either side of the bed. Looking for the bathroom we both excited in two directions and ran into each other in the bathroom behind the bed. There was no door on the shower, thankfully there was one on the closet. If you took a shower you were in plain site.The phrase ""I am in the shower"" became a watchword or not , watch word. I am not a prude but I do like to be on my own , privately in the shower. The restaurant was wonderful and the service great . It is a pet friendly place and the staff in the spa were profrssional. I am in the shower don't look , not a pretty site.",
5,Fabulous Spa & Resort,"We had a super relaxing visit to this resort. We spent 2 nights here. Food is unbelievable! Mud slide experience was amazing. Fitness facility is awesome. Pools, spa, bars were great! Service was spectacular. Sommelier Scott is super good. Wished we spent our whole vacation here...",
5,Perfectly magical honeymoon destination,"We have stayed at Solage a number of times, but this trip was for our honeymoon, and it did not disappoint. The stay was magical. The food, service, wine, pool, room... every aspect of Solage is as top notch as ever. We did the Starlight Experience one evening and that was a highlight (highly recommended for a romantic evening for two). We will definitely be back, multiple times in the future.",
5,I could live here,"Visited with family to explore the valley and its wineries. We've been to Napa many times but this visit was a favorite. I love Solage. I love the landscaping - peaceful and true to the aesthetic of the area - and the property offers what we wanted - peace and quiet in an upscale low key environment that offers lots of amenities. We loved Solbar, the workout facility, the porches and the simple but elegant rooms. Would love to return anytime. P.S. Jason is really a gem - seek him out to help set up wineries and restaurants.",
4,Great place to stay in the heart of wine country!,"You won't be disappointed in this lovely contemporary resort. The pool and the restaurant are keys to relaxation and enjoyment. Grounds are well maintained and rooms are conveniently placed and appointed with fine linens, water and coffee. We hired a wine tour guide when we visited the resort for our 3rd anniversary. He was the best tour guide for this area. If you need a referral I'd be glad to share his company name and contact information. The best to you on your planned getaway to this fabulous wine country and northern California. The place to be and live!",
5,Absolutely Fabulous!,"I have stayed at Solage many times: on couples trips, with girlfriends for a spa getaway, as well as family trips with my twin boys. I have enjoyed each stay immensely and recommend this resort to my clients. Here are the reasons I love it:

The location. Calistoga has stunning natural beauty, with arguably some of the best views in the valley. Since each cottage comes with two bikes, you can easily enjoy the surroundings by going for a bike ride. The fresh air alone instantly relaxes me. The resort is private, yet close enough to ride your bike or take a quick drive to the town for coffee, lunch or dinner.

The rooms. I love that each guest has a cottage with a patio - perfect for morning coffee. The rooms and bathrooms are immaculate and spacious with a modern wine country design.

The pool. I believe Solage has the largest pool in the valley. It is hard to pull yourself away from this pool - the views are spectacular as is the pool service. Solage also offers a separate family pool for kids. This is a HUGE benefit to those of us with children.

The spa. Wonderful services, a great juice bar, separate spa pool plus a heated mineral pool and cold plunge. Can easily spend all day here.

The dining. Michelin-starred dining at Solbar. Speaks for itself. Dining outside on patio is a must-experience, even if not staying at the resort. Be sure to book dinner in advance.

The vibe. Solage has a bit of a cool vibe - contemporary and stylish; friendly and relaxed.

I cannot say enough about this resort and cannot wait for my next visit.",
5,Great spot for a large group,"Love the location of this resort. Love the staff who helped - Erica, Vivien, Cassandra for group reservations & Shawn who was our banquet management. We hosted 50 top performing employees for a weekend away and had a fantastic experience. We wil be back again.",
2,No restaurant for hotel guests,The only $800/night hotel in the world with effectively no restaurant. We stayed there 2 nights and were very much looking forward to Solbar. Unfortunately they were fully booked and had no availability for dinner on either night even though we were staying at the hotel. At the very least they should either open a second restaurant on the property or give hotel guests priority at Solbar so people who stay there have a place to eat.,
1,Bad service,"We traveled during the heatwave and there was no air conditioning.
I have traveled extensively, and this hotel service is like a 1 star.
We asked for the air conditioning to be fixed, and it wasn't. We were never offered a discount.
Day 2: It is over 100 degrees outside and still, 85 degrees in the room with a broken air conditioner.
Paid $900 per night on Labor Day weekend during one of the worst heatwaves in history, and no air conditioning.
Staff didn't seem to care at all.
I wish I had stayed at Mountain Home ranch for just over $100 a night. I stayed there as a kid, and never had a problem whatsoever. As an adult, I would expect more.
At Solage, they told me that someone comes into your room to shut off the air conditioning to save money for the hotel.
No Thanks, but I recommend that you pass on this ridiculously overpriced hotel which can't seem to get their service model together to put the customer first.",
5,oasis of peace and tranquility in mountain valley,"Great weather, poolside fun, and delicious food at your fingertips at this classy but not ornate resort. all quite elegance, super spa and ultra warm service 24/7. Michelin starred restaurant deserves the award with superb new american dining under outdoor pergola",
5,Extraordinary stay,"What a trip.....awesome views, beautiful spa, exceptional restaurant, extraordinary service.....
Room was beautifully appointed.....robes, linens, fully stocked kitchenette, great outdoor area that makes the room seem bigger.
Service and food at Solbar make it a meal to remember. Spa with outdoor areas is a great place to spend a day.
We will be back to take advantage of a five star resort in a beautiful, relaxed town.",
5,A great stay!,"Great food, service, and VERY nice rooms...almost like little condos.
The pool is full service with great views. Total attention to service at the hotel. When we ate at the restaurant the service was slow and the food was a solid B-. With all that said, I would stay here again.",
5,Chef change - same great quality,"Place is always super friendly and many great choices including healthy dishes. Mixology is exceptional. Wait staff is the perfect mix of service and entertainment. Duck and pork , exquisite! I do not hesitate to recommend!",
5,Relaxing Stay in Calistoga,"Enjoyed a four night stay in a Silverado Suite in this expansive Calistoga resort. Basically a single large room, with a large divider separating the living room area from the bedroom. Living room had a great gas fireplace, which was great on the cool mornings. Bathroom was quite spacious, with a large walk-in shower. Patio was cozy and comfortable, and featured a private hot tub / jacuzzi. Overall the facilities were very good, though we had some day one issues with inoperative air conditioning, and clogged shower drains. Best part of the resort is the excellent Michelin-starred restaurant, Solbar. We enjoyed both dinner and breakfast on the outdoor Solbar patio, and found both the food and service first rate. Another great bonus is the resort partnership with Mercedes – we were able to borrow a Mercedes convertible for our tour through the local vineyards. Definitely, the way to go! Will look forward eagerly to a future stay.",
5,Awesome Spa,"Beautiful setting with first class service. Food was creative
And delicious. Great unique options for relaxing and detoxing in the Spa.
I particularly enjoyed the 50 meter salt water pool. Perfect for swimming laps. Enjoyed the resort so much we only left the grounds once for dinner",
5,Napa Holiday,"Really love this hotel. The property is absolutely beautiful and well-maintained. From the minute you check in to the minute you check out everyone is absolutely wonderful to you. Each guest receives a glass of wine upon arrival rooms are set in small cottages where you'll have two bicycles at your disposal. The rooms are absolutely beautiful with the private terrace area spacious layout, and clean. The food and service are excellent. The pool area very nice ,quiet and comfortable. My absolute favorite part of this hotel is the spa. The mudslide is a must! This is the perfect place to go to relax enjoy great food good wine and a beautiful landscape. Very close to all of the wineries. Highly recommend.",
5,A wonderful stay in Napa Valley,"We spent a great 5 days at Solage Resort!
We came to the Valley to relax and visit wineries in the area and were not disappointed.
Solage was the perfect place to unwind, be pampered, and serve as our connection to the many wineries found close by. Our Suite was quiet and very private; the food excellent; the friendly pool staff took care of our every need; the workout facility perfect for our stay and the spa and mineral pools a great experience for the ladies.
Their concierge, Jason, was very helpful in making reservations for the wineries we wanted to visit and making suggestions on the restaurants we should try.
Solage was perfect for our stay in Napa Valley.",
5,Pure enjoyment,Solage continues to be the place we go to from SF to completely relax. There pool is my favorite almost in the world - swimming laps in cool mineral water cannot be beat. The spa is so relaxing and the restaurant with its new Italian chef is the perfect combo of relaxed and elegant.,
5,Perfect Getaway,The Solage was truly the most relaxing place we've ever been. The rooms and grounds are absolutely lovely. The service was close to impeccable and the spa treatments were dreamy. We can't wait to return!!!,
5,Best resort!,"Solage has everything you could want in a stay! The private cottages are so quiet and peaceful, the pool is so relaxing and beautiful, the fitness center is amazing and offers free classes daily, the spa is world class and should not be missed, and Solbar is fantastic with many options! I cannot think of one thing that I would change about our stay. We have stayed at Solage every year for the past 5 years and the consistency they offer is truly remarkable. We can't wait to go back!",
5,5* Resort / Weak Spa Services,"In Napa Valley where everyone seemingly embraces the concept of 'haute' hospitality it shouldn't be surprising that a premium destination resort like the Solage left a nothing to be desired.

Of course, the Solage resort has many, many strengths. The location is near enough to downtown Calistoga you can stroll there, the property and rooms offer privacy and tranquility - the entire resort is kept spotlessly clean and beautifully landscaped. The amenities are also top-tier (pool, fitness center, bar, restaurant, free bicycles, meeting room).

The rooms are clean, updated, spacious and have great bedding/sundries and for those warm summer days ... great A/C. There is a walkout patio with an arbor cover ... great place for evening stargazing with a glass of Napa's finest!

My wife and I each had a 60 minute massage that didn't meet our expectations. We each separately thought that our respective masseuse was either undertrained or unexperienced. We've visited a number of spas, our experience at Solage was one of the weaker ones.

The only 'minor' service issue that my wife and I experienced was at check-in when the desk staff handled our check-in kind of impersonally and hastily. Certainly, they should be aware that its guests are excited about checking into the Solage; a warm and friendly greeting goes a long way to starting the visit on the right foot.

We had our last dinner of the visit at the Solbar ... where the staff, views (outdoor seating), menu and wine list were all excellent. Even in an area loaded wth great dining options, Solbar is a great choice.

All in all, there's every reason we will return to Solage, it has everything we like in the right location.",
5,A 5-star resort in prime wine country,"Solage Calistoga is a swish yet relaxed hotel and spa with one of the biggest swimming pools I've ever seen! We were there for a nearby wedding, and it was the perfect place to get over our jet lag, having flown out from London, and to recover from a degree of wedding-related excess... The rooms are exceptionally comfortable, there are bikes to ride around on, which is fun, and a terrific restaurant with
a very well-stocked bar. The lemon ricotta pancakes are sensational for breakfast, and there's an extremely well-equipped gym in which you can attempt to limit the damage. The spa is terrific too - I recommend the detoxing mud slide treatment - and the staff are fantastic. We had a lovely time.",
2,"The three Seasons, in a beautiful location","The staff and management fall way short of what they aspire to be. I wonderfully designed property in a beautiful location priced for perfection and delivers far less. So much was good to great, bit the weakest links destroy the experience. The new check is OK, but a major step down from the previous star,",
4,A good place to stay in Napa,"The resort looks great on arrival, check-in was slow but staff pleasant and welcoming. Rooms are clean and bright, comfortable bed, good shower. Great cocktails at bar area (which seemed a little small given the size of resort). The restaurant menu is lacking great dishes for lunch and dinner and could be improved. Breakfast was good. The spa is great and treatments A+. Concierge was efficient and helpful with booking transport, restaurants, winery tour in advance.",
2,High Expectations and Disappointing Experience,"Substandard results from a 5 star resort is just not acceptable.

On a positive note; lovely casita, comfortable beds, large shower, lovely patio and large bathroom. That's where it ends!

Our disappointment started at check in. We arrived at about 2:30 and were advised our room was not ready. We were offered complimentary wine, but declined and decided to have lunch. We were advised we would be contacted via cell phone when our room was ready.

We were greeted by the hostess and asked for a table inside, since it was very hot. We were told there were no tables available inside so we sat outside. Lunch was nice, but nothing special. We returned to the reception desk and were told a message was left for us on our cell phone. We advised we didn't receive any message. Upon further investigation, the wrong number was called because another guest's information was in our registration envelope. We did receive a bottle of wine for the inconvenience. Later that day, we discovered ants crawling all over the in room desk. We contacted the front desk and they offered to change our room or they could send an exterminator. We chose to remain in the room rather than have to repack. Around midnight we experienced a total blackout.

We had an 8:00pm dinner reservation for an outside table at their Michelin one star rated Solbar restaurant. We arrived on time and were greeted by the same hostess from lunch. We were told our table wasn't available and it would be at least a half hour for a table outside. BTW ... the reservation was made March 3rd, 4 months prior. We decided, once again, to acquiesce and we sat inside. We were greeted by Sarah. She was upbeat and friendly. We ordered the octopus and agretti. Presentation was OK as was the food. It was nothing special. Our entrees of duck and black cod were also underwhelming. The duck was tough! The final tasteless dish was the sweet corn fritters. They lacked flavor and were definitely not sweet! We told Sarah they were underwhelming and without flavor. To her credit, she sent over the manager who offered a different dessert. However, at this point, we just wanted nothing else from the kitchen. We had enough disappointing and flavorless food!

All this leaves us wondering how could a Michelin Star restaurant be so mediocre?

In short, we arrived with the expectation that we were going to experience the exceptional and in the end, our experience was quite disappointing!!!!!",
4,Overhyped and missing some marks,"Stayed here for our 20 year anniversary 7.18 thru 7.20. We awoke to a room crawling with ants in the sleeping area on the desk as well as all over the bathroom sink and on the toilet seat. They quickly sent someone to spray but honestly who wants to be in a room full of poison? We requested to be moved, which they did relocate us within an hour. When packing found a large dead cockroach in the bottom of the closet. So unfortunately, this dampened our impression of the resort immediately, not what you would expect for an Auberge hotel . They did send cheese and wine but having to pack and move disrupted the 2 day experience and we didn't unpack a 2nd time so lived out of a suitcase for the next 24 hours. Personally, I think the resort fails on delivering a memorable Napa Valley experience. Room decor is minimalist and pool area reminded me of what a Holiday Inn Express pool might look like. Maybe their goal was less is more but it didnt resonate with me whose career is creating memorable living spaces (interior designer). Positives : the restaurant decor and quality of food/drink. But better value is Indian Springs and Hotel Yountville, all of which we have stayed previously and have personality. We paid around $500 per night and felt it was about $125 too much. Auberge resorts typically exude luxury, this felt like the sister B brand.",
5,Best vacation spot in Northern California,"Solage is always an A+ vacation. The staff is friendly and welcoming, and the pool is amazing. They always treat my three children so nicely and have fun special events for the kids (including a bocce tournament on Saturday morning)! The food is delicious. It's our favorite vacation spot, hands down. They think of every detail and make it perfect.",
3,Solage,"We traveled with our small child. Let me start by saying, it's wine country, not Disneyland. I get it. Even so, this resort is OK for families. Kid's pool is depressing which is why it's not in the gallery and if your child is young like mine you have to stayat the kid's pool. Don't plan on coming back. Looks nice online but lacks depth of a real 5 star resort.",
5,Always a Great Experience,"Solage has something for every member of the family to make your stay enjoyable and memorable; spa, great food and wine, adult and kids pool, bikes, great service, comfortable casitas, and it's wrapped in a comfortable and upscale package.",
5,Fantastic setting and great food,"Lunch time visit for meal. Large family group sat outside under the canopy and trees, lovely views and great swimming pool for guests.
The food and wine were superb and the service was first class. Whole experience was unforgettable, just a shame it is so far from home( UK ).
AND compared to the Bay area very inexpensive.",
5,Best Ever,"We stayed here for 2 nights and wished we could have stayed for me. WOW what an experience we had. From the moment you arrive the property has a real feel about it. Upon check in you are greeted with super friendly staff who offer you a glass of wine whilst you are completing the check in, great start. All the rooms are individual studio apartments with a great amount of privacy. Not to mention each room comes with 2 bikes so that you can ride around the Property. Pool area is just amazing. Main pool has a minimum age of 13. Breakfast and dinner options although expensive the quality and service is exceptional. If you are wanting to treat yourself and stay somewhere special the looks is over, this is the property!",
5,"Peaceful, RELAXING - Ooo La Laaaa","What an incredible piece of property, in the heart of Napa Valley. The rooms which are called ""Studios"" are designed perfectly. I mean perfectly! Stand alone shower and stand-alone tub (which is my favorite), Ceiling fan with several settings - that's a PLUS (in this heat sometimes). Probably the largest TV I've ever seen inside of a hotel room. Fresh mint infused water by your bed side. Beautiful espresso machine in-room as well as a fire place. Complimentary bikes for your leisure during your entire stay. Its a Beautiful Resort, and I haven't even mention all the spa amentities - All I'm going to say, is you will not be disappointed. PROMISE.",
5,Amazingly perfect...in every way!,"One of the most amazing experiences I have ever had. The service was outstanding and the people were incredibly friendly and helpful. The attention to details and the indulgent customer service needs to be commended. It doesn't happen enough today even at the nicest of resorts. Yours was attentive and thoughtful while discerning and private at the same time. The services and accommodations were splendid. Every touch, every service was wonderful and I loved having my own cabin. It was the ultimate escape and indulgent pampering vacation for me and I will be back as soon as I can. And the surrounding views made it pure heaven! I never Facebook about a place, but I did about Solage...telling all my friends. See you soon!",
5,Great Place!,"Our Cottage was very well maintained and the hot tub was an exciting feature. Staff was extremely friendly and helpful, Spa was just Great! Don't forget to take one of new Mercedes for a spin.. Free..",
5,The perfect spot!!!,"Solage is such a unique experience with your own luxurios cottage terrace and bikes. We stayed for 5 nites and had the opportunity to have a couples mudslide so much fun and so unique.
Loved the spa so much!!!
The house cars were so much fun got to drive to the top of the valley fab views
Attended many receptions they were all beutiful!
Food and bar drinks are all fantastic you will love everything!
Staff was so friendly and accomodating you will truly remember this vacation!!!",
5,Anniversary,"We stayed here for our ten year wedding anniversary. Everything was excellent. It is small enough to feel special. You are very close to town and wineries, so you can just jump on onef their bikes. You never feel like you are in a big resort.",
5,Fantastic,"This was a return visit. Everything even better than 2015. Service - this is how service should be. Needs anticipated. Staff knew our names and greeted us by name. Food is fantastic - both Solbar and room service. Pool is great and the attentiveness of the service really good. The whole resort has an air of peace and tranquility- only sound is birdsong. Spa, fitness centre and free daily classes including yoga and reformer Pilates - great. While rates are not cheap this is value for money in that you are spoiled and pampered from the moment you arrive. We moved from here to a hotel in Healdsburg- higher room rate - but no comparison in level of service excellence.
Solage - thank you for a wonderful vacation",
4,Well located excellent food,"Spa, food and location are outstanding. Solbar was a spectacular meal. Truly a well deserved Michelin star. However for the price room amenities, bathroom fittings could have been more updated. The room cleaning and replenishment of the company complimentary beverages etc was not great and we had to ask for water and coffee etc multiple times. The wifi connectivity was VERY poor in our room",
5,Fabulous,"I am very picky about resorts/hotels and this one passed with flying colors. Great staff, food,room, pool, spa. We had room 65 and I loved the location and privacy! I am a Four Seasons kind of person and felt that this resort rivaled them in their customer service and attention to detail. The spa was amazing and all guests can take advantage of it's facilities!",
5,Solage,We've never such an incredible experience as we have had at Solage! From the moment we stepped out of our car to the time we had to depart every part of our experience was exceptional. We can't wait to return!,
5,Perfect resort to represent the modern side of Wine Country,"This place is incredible - the rooms are gorgeously decorated with high-end furniture in muted colors, all of it situated on beautifully maintained & extensive grounds, located in one of the best towns of Napa Valley. Everything is truly top notch: excellent bathroom amenities, a steam shower in the bathroom, a private whirlpool in the back yard with complete privacy, a fireplace in the living room section of the room, a sparkling and large central pool surrounded by palm trees, well-maintained bicycles that can be rented free of charge to ride into town with, electric car charging station, and on and on it goes.

Breakfast in the on-site restaurant is a standout - everything sounded so incredibly delicious that we ordered way too much food. Service is prompt, friendly and efficient. So one of the bed & breakfast packages is definitely worth considering.

The on-site spa is one of the largest spas I have ever seen at a hotel resort and features yet another set of pools and seemingly endless array of treatment options ranging from mud baths to traditional massages.

The downtown part of Calistoga is a short drive, a 20 minute walk, or a 5 minute bike ride away and offers excellent restaurant choices, wine tasting, shopping and more spas if you didn't get your spa fix at Solage.",
5,Awesome girls get away,"Had a fabulous stay with my sister and two of her daughters. The hotel staff was very friendly and helpful, and every aspect was enjoyable. My nieces loved riding around on the cruiser bikes, and the poolside lounging was very relaxing. I liked the fact that it was a mixed clientele in age--families with children, retirees, and couples. I would stay again in a heartbeat!",
5,Understated Elegance,"I just returned from a four night stay at Solage Calistoga. This is a five star resort in every sense of the word. We stayed in a studio, however the resort also offers suites. Every room is located in a small private house on beautifully manicured grounds. Our room had two double beds, a small sitting area, a very private patio. a kitchen area with a mini fridge including complimentary non-alcoholic beverages and coffee maker and a large bathroom with a double sink, stone shower and sitting alcove. The bed was beyond comfortable with luxury linens and pillows. A spacious closet and in-room safe was also provided. The resort has a gym and a beautiful spa which offers a variety of treatments, however they were very pricey. I enjoyed spending time in the relaxation room and using the private outdoor shower. There area number of swimming pools on the property with some exclusive to adults only. The restaurant offers indoor and outdoor seating as well as room service. The food was delicious but very expensive. The customer service at the resort was extraordinary. All of the staff were helpful and friendly. I hope to return to Solage Calistoga for another memorable vacation.",
5,Just incredible!,"From the pool party complete with DJ, to the amazing spa treatments, to the sublime food [breakfast, lunch & dinner], to the bikes w/the immediate proximity to the Calistoga, to the sublime cottage, to the straight-out-of-a-movie setting, to the super friendly team that always waves and smiles ... well, Solage is as good as it can possibly get. Gen'l Mgr PK is just doing an amazing job.",
5,An amazing resort,"We had the most amazing stay here. We stayed for my boyfriend's birthday and they gave us a complementary bottle of wine in our room and a card wishing him a happy birthday. They also had treats, food bowls and a bed set out for our dog. They were able to accommodate an early check in time which was awesome! They really deliver amazing customer service.

Our room was clean, nicely decorated and spacious. We had a beautiful private patio overlooking oak trees. The positioning of the studio/patio was well thought out because not one person walked past our patio the entire time we were there, making it feel very private. The grounds are just amazing. There are hills all around which make it feel like you are way out in the middle of nowhere even though you are within a five minute drive to downtown Calistoga.

I can't say enough about Solbar! The food was delicious. The atmosphere is so relaxing and the cocktails were amazing. We also loved breakfast both days and really enjoyed the burger off the lounge menu on our second night. So simple but one of the best we'd ever had.

One of our favorite experiences here was Starlight at the bathhouse. You can rent the entire mineral pool/hot tub area at the spa from 8:30p-10:30p. It's so quiet and peaceful. They provide champagne and dessert, robes and towels, and play beautiful music as you relax under the stars. It was such a treat and we left feeling so relaxed.

I just can't say enough good things about Solage. It's well worth the price, which is high, but it's a resort, not a hotel so you do get what you pay for. I would love to stay again!",
5,A World Class Spa Getaway,If you are going to Napa Valley then this is a fantastic retreat both before and after wine tasting. A world class spa with a world class dining experience at Solbar. A bit of a distance from the town of Napa but well worth it.,
5,pampering perfection,"On a work and personal trip and decided to indulge for my 50th birthday. So glad that I chose this resort. I had just enough me-time and still enough time to see my friends and new places. The mineral baths and pool were my go-to place every morning. The bike outside my bungalow was handy to get around. The place was so clean and everything was detail oriented. If felt like a quiet getaway, even though its right my Silverado Trail. It was easy to access the many wineries from this location, as well.",
5,Wonderful,"Stayed here for 3 nights. Would love to return. The studio room was very comfortable. The service prompt and the pools, spa and fitness center make this a great place to stay for while taking in wine country. Spent a day a very nice day at the spa. Dinner at Solbar was exceptional.",
5,Pool party at Solage in Calistoga,"Great place to relax.
The service was excellent.
Food was fantastic
the room was clean and quiet.
The pool is wonderful to hang out at all day long. Once I had a few drinks I was on my way to a most relaxed time of my life.",
5,Always amazing,"We went there for our honeymoon for the 1st time in summer 2015. We then went back again for our holiday in August 2016 as we love Napa so much! The hotel rooms are like your own little house and you can park outside your room directly. The swimming pool is one of the largest ones I've been to in the many hotels i've visited.
Even though we go in summer at peak season, the hotel doesn't feel cramped as the place is so big and spacious. The breakfast and dinner is also amazing. Vegetables in Napa Valley are one of the best - esp the tomatoes - they are so juicy and sweet!",
5,Better than most everywhere else,"We had heard that Solage had excellent and better priced meals then most of the local competition. We were not disappointed! Beautiful dining room as well as outside seating. We were at the bar, which was also lovely. Everything we ordered was first rate, beginning with The chilled avocado gazpacho. We split a Reuben sandwich, which was just fine for the two of us. Great wine selection, service, and general ambience make this a great place for brunch, lunch, or dinner. Will be back!",
5,Great get away from foggy San Francisco!,"Wonderful rooms, dining and environment. Mud slide very relaxing. You get your own bucket of mud! The ground are beautiful and they provide bike to get around. Breakfast delivery to your room was a definite plus.",
4,Stayed 2 nights using credit card reward points,"As stated in the title of this review, we did not use our own money to stay at this spa resort (although we were required to be charged $25/night resort fee during checkout) so please keep that in mind. We made our room reservation approximately 2 months out and had requested early check in (noon). On the day of arrival, they were not able to accommodate this request so we were forced to hang out by the pool until 4pm. Our 2 queen bed unit was located towards the back end of the spa so it was super quiet (compared to those units next to the pool). The room itself was spacious but because it was near the wilderness and next to protected native vegetative grounds, there were occasional bugs that found itself into the room! Bugs such as ticks, spiders, beetles, etc. I wished they would've sprayed for bugs, but I don't think that's an option for them. There a mini-fridge in the room and all sodas and bottled water are complimentary. The same goes for the Nespresso machine and espresso pods. There was supposed to be an ipad in the room to use for order room service, request ice, and other requests but it was missing so we had to phone in our requests. There were 2 bikes located outside of the room for use but we did not use them. Noticed that there were no brakes plus there were no bike locks to use so . . . use them with caution as you are responsible for damaged or stolen bikes I would assume.

We dined at the on property Solbar and chose the $80 four course meal. Each course consisted of about 6 choices. Although this restaurant is a 1 Michelin star restaurant, some of the dishes were on the salty side and didn't blow our minds for the price. Service however was top notch and the waiter/waitress will go above and beyond to please you.

The geo-thermo pool was really nice to swim in at 90 deg F. Water felt like ocean water with no chlorine in it so it was awesome to swim without goggles. This resort did have a separate kid's pool with a jacuzzi nearby for adults to hangout in while supervising their kids.

Exercise classes were offered complimentary as well as borrowing a Mercedes car for the day (although we did not take advantage of these perks).

All in all, this resort was nice, however, I felt that it didn't offer that many activities to do nor was it that big (relatively speaking). Perhaps it needed more dining choices onsite? Would I visit this resort again using my own money next time? Unfortunately, for some reason, this resort didn't wow me enough to justify using my own money.

As a side recommendation, go check out Gott's Roadside diner in St. Helena. Delish burgers and shakes!",
5,Sublime,"Never have I felt so pampered and relaxed than at Solage. This place is the epitome of elegance and casual sophistication. The pools are amazing - especially the geothermal mineral pool, kept at about 90 degrees. The restaurant is top notch. The room and bathroom were sleek and appealingly appointed. Loved the two bikes, the gardens, and the private patio. Staff is attentive yet unobtrusive. Highly recommend.",
5,Fantastic spa and culinary experience,"Lovely resort with great service, food, spa and pool. Perfect location for rest and relaxation that is close to great restaurants and vineyards. Solbar is a must. Body wrap spa treatment was heavenly. Better location for couples versus families.",
5,Fantastic property in a great setting,"We spent a couple of nights at the Solage and had a wonderful time. The first day the weather was not great but the spa facility meant that you could still swim outside in their highly warmed pool. The next two days the weather was great and any of the pools were great. The rooms are lovely with great modern features - though the iPads tend to freeze and don't work particularly well - so for example ordering bed in breakfast was a bit uncertain! The only niggle that we had here was about having to book for dining. Not knowing that the restaurant gets heavily booked by non residents of the hotel we had not booked a table in advance for the nights we stayed. A simple email to all residents at the time of booking could have invited guests to book a table for lunch or dinner. Alternatively setting some tables aside for residents would have been sensible. However, after we complained about having travelled for 4 hours to get to the hotel to be told we could not eat dinner on the property - they did manage to find us a table. Top tip: book your restaurant dinner table in advance otherwise it will be bar food, in room dining or heading in to town.",
5,1 + bonus night,"We made a last minute trip to Napa and after a day of touring and stopping at a few hotels along the way we ended up booking a room at Solage for the night. Since we checked in late we asked and were given a promo price that included breakfast. Our room (a king room) was a bit small, but still nice with a comfortable bed and at the foot of it a place to sit and have a snack. The hotel grounds are expansive, however walking from our room to the restaurant was a series of left and rights that made us feel like we should have dropped bread crumbs to find our way back, especially at night. The service was very friendly and the restaurant service staff were very helpful with menu recommendations. We were only planning on staying a night, but decided during breakfast to spend another night. I went to the front desk and they accommodated us without an issue and while we didn't get our extra special promo pricing they came close which was very much appreciated. The town of Calistoga is nearby and the wineries are not far either. Being on the Silverado Trail allows one to bypass the traffic on Hwy 128. Auberge du Soleil a sister hotel has nicer views from the restaurant, however for this trip the friendly and helpful staff at the Solage was perfect.",
3,Not Clean Enough,"So much is good here -- most importantly all the staff. The grounds are very nice, too. The massages are hit or miss; some very good, others quite average.

They have a cleanliness problem, however. My room was basically clean, except for the bathroom walls. I won't go into details, but not nice at all.

In the pool area the steam room appeared to be clean one day and then the next smelled moldy.

I hope they address these issues and oversee housekeeping more closely.",
4,Great Restaraunt in Calistoga,"Napa Valley has some great restaurants and Solage is one of them. Though not in the same league as the renowned French Laundry which Michelin gives its highest 3 star rating. The Solage hotel, spa and Restaraunt is owned by Auberge which owns Auberge du Soleil just a few miles down the Silverado Trail. Meadowood too is just a few miles south of Solage. So Solage has to compete at a pretty high level both on quality and service and it did not disappoint. We went there for lunch and I had the Bannh Mi sandwich , and my friends had a Falafal Sandwich and another had Salmon. Oh and we started off we a Avacado Gazpacho soup which was excellent. They have a full bar and a good wine list. Indoor and Outdoor seating with heaters for the outside. Service is friendly and fast but not rushed. Highly recommend this place for Lunch or dinner",
5,"If you have the money, then you cannot go wrong here!","Beautiful property. Quiet and yet not far from many things in Northern Napa Valley. However, having a rental car is highly recommended. One surprise here is that the property does have several cars that you can borrow (subject to availability, of course).

Room are all cottages. No elevators!!! Each cottage has 2 beach cruiser bicycles for you to use. Rooms are furnished just right. Even have a private patio with each room. Mini fridge is stocked with water and sodas at no add'l cost. The restaurant, Solbar, is very good.

Service from all the staff was excellent. Would stay there again.",
5,Relaxing as always,"Solage remains the best, most relaxing spot to spend a weekend at in Napa and unwind. The Spa in particular is worth a trip in and of itself. But so is the main pool, the bar lounge and the restaurant.",
5,Family celebration of our Golden Wedding Anniversary.,"We only booked lunch for our special occasion. It was superb.The staff looked after us and made helpful recommendations. Little Tommy the toddler joined his English grand pa and grandma and uncle and auntie all the way from Australia. The he enjoyed the attention of the staff whilst we enjoyed a perfect lunch and superb champers and white wines.
This was a day to remember by us all.
Many thanks to all that made it so.",
5,Perfection in Calistoga,Visited in February with two friends for a girls weekend. We loved every minute at Solage from the lovely glass of wine on arrival to soaking in the mineral pool in the evening to cocktails at SolBar. The cottage accommodations are spacious and have every amenity under the sun. Beds are so comfy. You will want to stay again and again.,
5,Girls Getaway,"I highly recommend this experience for a girls getaway. The service, the spa, the specialness of this place is incredible. Every detail was so thoughtful and even if there was the slightest hiccup it was overcome by the entire staffs responsiveness. I cannot wait to come back with the hubby for more of what this beautiful place has to offer.",
5,Pampering at its best!,"My husband I went here originally to take part in qigong with Linda Burquez. We decided to stay at the Resort and booked a room and a ""mud slide"" treatment. This place has service down! The spa was perfect. Rustic, outdoors and elegance all mixed into one yummy experience. This is a bucket list place if you love spas and service.",
5,"Great service, food and ambiance","Solage is great to stay, spa or just visit for a long fun lunch with friends. I have several friends who are members and I have had some of my favorite Napa valley lunches at Solage. The food is local and delicious and their wine menu is very comprehensive and supplied all the minerals whites and dry rose's we have wanted.",
4,Very private wellness retreat,"Private adequate rooms with free wifi. What really makes it work is the amenities. The superb spa and separate pool areas for families and adults. Cruiser bikes with each studio. Pet friendly. Flat screen TV and pebble stone floored showers are a plus. It is the huge spa with a comprehensive treatment menu, mineral pools, and gym that leave a lasting impression. Very environmentally focused practices throughout the resort. Michelin rated Solarbar restaurant serves healthy ingredient driven fare
Pricey stay but try at beginning or end of season for best rates.",
3,This is a Luxury Brand?,"We've booked a pretty phenomenal itinerary for a meandering LA to Napa Road Trip. I'll try to not act too petulant about my experience with Solage.

1. We're staying at Montage, St. Regis and other 'brands' along our trip. We liked the look of Solage, and the Auberge brand, enough to make it our choice for our Napa leg

2. My wife called with our specific date request (weeknights in Mid May). We were quoted a rate on the phone, were told by a Sarah that she would email the quote (always need to see the fees) and would hold the room for an hour while she reached me for an OK.

3. Within 15 minutes I gave the thumbs up and my wife called to confirm the Reservation. The email with a quote never arrived. When my wife called back, she was told there were multiple Sarah's and asked which one did she speak with (um, maybe the one who quotes Reservations).

4. No Sarah ever turned up. And our room was 'magically' booked in the 15 window wait and the rate went up $50/night. My wife, while frustrated, agreed to the increased rate and booked the room.

5. When she told me about it that night, I asked for her to demand the 'original agreement' or cancel the reservation. She called at 8pm on a weeknight. There was literally no answer. In two phone calls.

6. I immediately booked three nights at the nearby Resort that starts with a B.

7. When my wife called to cancel the reservation at Solage there was absolute disinterest in 'why'.

8. I unsubscribed from the Auberge e-mail list.",
4,Beautiful and Pricey,We came by for Easter breakfast. The grounds are lovely and the restaurant is both upscale yet comfortable. The service was very good as was the food-- but overpriced. Nonetheless we enjoyed ourselves.,
5,Simply Perfect,"Idyllic beautiful hotel in the heart of Napa wine country. Great guests rooms, brilliant facilities and the most amazing, delicious food and cocktails/wine. Can't wait to go back and drift lazily around the property on the bicycles provided, take the complimentary Mercedes out for a trip to the vineyards and enjoy more delicious meals at SolBar.",
5,A class act,"Solage is beautiful, family friendly, and the service is top notch. Even my 8 year old said ""wow everyone here is so nice!"" The lounge and Solbar restaurants have excellent food for adults and kids and easily accommodated our Passover restrictions. As noted the kids pool area is smaller than the main one but still a lot of fun and very warm. Room service brought milk for kids in minutes and remembered our requests the next day. The location is close to many family friendly activities. My only wish is that there were more bedding options for a family than two queens. Highly recommended.",
5,Another blissful solage experience,"As always a top notch, luxurious, delicious experience. Spa and in room dining for breakfast and dinner (restaurant was booked for dinner and it turned out to be absolutely wonderful anyway, served in our room), with lunches at sol bar where they offered us blankets because we sat outside and looked chilly, for two and a half days... I couldn't have been a more blissed out birthday girl. Even in the rain!",
5,First Class Cottages,"We have stayed here several times and it never fails. From the individual cottages to the amazing food and service, it is always a great choice when wine tasting in the Napa Valley. You really appreciate nature in this kind of setting.",
5,Quiet and elegant..,"A perfect family escape for a couple days in a great location on the edge of town.
Could bike or walk into town. No need to leave the resort as it has everything you need to relax and enjoy the great service.
Loved the thermal pools, steam room, and our host Anthony in the spa area was fantastic.",
5,Oasis in Napa Valley,"My wife and I attended a business function at the Solage for 3 days and thoroughly enjoyed the resort. It's a small property with each ""room"" being an individual sort of bungalow (or one of 2 connected together) which gave it a very nice secluded feel to it. The service was excellent from the time we checked in (immediately served a glass of nice quality wine) through check out and every step in between. The bar and restaurant have a very good menu with plenty of healthy and indulgent options. My wife enjoyed her ""Signature Massage"" at the spa and thought it was one of the best she has ever experienced. We would definitely stay at this resort again.

Only one small complaint. There was minimal in room storage. No dressers, just a few small shelves in the closet, and no storage of any kind in the bathroom (although the entire area under the sink was wide open).",
5,Modern Cottages,"We stayed here w/ 4 other couples for 2 nights. We didn't have much time to really explore the resort because we were out at vineyards and it rained the whole time we were there. The services was very cordial and the food was very good at the restaurant. We ate breakfast and dinner, both of which were scrumptious, but very expensive. The rooms were clean and modern w/ tub and shower. I did get the mudslide spa treatment. They give you a tub of mud and you slather it all over and rest for 15 minutes, then a 10 min soak in hot bath, and finally a 10 min sonic type of nap. It was very relaxing. We would definitely stay again.",
5,Laid Back Luxury,"We stayed at Solage on our recent visit to Napa Valley. We prefer Calistoga to the other valley villages. It is quiet and doesn't have the traffic and tourists we found elsewhere in the valley. The Inn is composed of separate cottages each with a private porch and outdoor seating. The cottages are situated in a manner to offer guests privacy and freedom from intrusion by other guests. Each cottage comes with bikes, and dogs are welcome. The resort has a beautiful spa with geothermal pools, yoga studio, fitness equipment and treatment rooms. The hotel also has a junior Olympic swimming pool. Service was friendly and attentive and made for a very relaxing weekend.",
5,"Solage, perfect for dogs and us humans who follow!","My wife and I and our yellow Labrador retriever recently stayed at Solage and the staff made her (our lab) feel as special as we did. Everyone, from the front desk team to the staff at Solbar restaurant, greeted our pup and went out of their way to make our experience enjoyable. Our room was great and the food wonderful. A perfect DogCation for all! From DogTrekker.com.",
5,Great Calistoga resort.,"My husband and I are planning our 4th visit to Solage. Great cottages, outstanding restaurant, beautiful pool and spa, excellent staff! It's a short drive to Calistoga's Main Street and St. Helena. The spa thermal pool is unbelievable. The resort also has a great workout room with state of the art equipment!",
5,Girlfriend Birthday Weekend,"Great weekend stay! She loved it. Very relaxing. Staff friendly and helpful. Mineral pools warm and relaxing. Private male and female pools and steam room were big plus. Great food at SolBar. Mercedes to drive, too. Vroom, vroom!!!",
5,Napa,Excellent resort. Very relaxing. Spa services were great. Not crowded. Beautiful views in the valley. All the staff made us feel welcomed and we hated to leave. Would recommend to anyone going to the valley,
5,True Luxury in Calistoga,"This was my third trip to Solage, and it never disappoints. Gorgeous facility, great food, very nice staff. Total relaxation. Calistoga is less crowded than say, Napa or Sonoma. You can easily ride one of their bikes or go for quiet walks. Spa is veery expensive but worth the pampering.",
5,TOP Notch Hotel & Spa in Wine Country,"My wife and I have stayed here twice in the last 2+ years and it's been awesome both times. For us, service is always above the bar. We arrived this time and it was raining, the valet came out and said ""don't get out - give me your driver's license and I'll check in for you"". So we just hung out; less than 5 min later he came back with keys to the room and a map and we were on our way.

The rooms are more like cottages, most semi-attached to another but no one lives on top of you, and unless you are next to loud crying babies (not a common occurrence I'd imagine here). We had King Beds with fireplace both times. The rooms have been spacious, with a bigger shower and bathroom area than I have at home, and a deck, sitting area with views of vines, trees and mountains. It's nouveau-ish, sleek, finely appointed and straight up comfortable as hell.

Workout room is great - lots of machines of all kinds. And if you go to Solage, you must do a spa. Mud and hot springs is the thing in Calistoga and you can do both here. Relaxing & gorgeously understated and pristine.

Food too is exceptional. Like, reallly, really great. This isn't your run of the mill hotel food. It's a must you eat there once - brunch is great, dinner is unbelievable. And Get the butterscotch pudding. It's ridiculous.

When I travel I tend to travel nice. And my wife and I think Solage is in our top 5 nicest hotels we've ever stayed at.",
4,Nice stay in the valley,"We had a nice stay at the Solage in Calistoga. My husband was running the Napa Valley Marathon, and the Solage is at the starting line (how convenient to roll out of bed and right to the starting line). The rooms are designed well, and quite comfortable. Unfortunately we were assigned a room close to the restaurant and could hear the bass from the music at Solbar. The staff was able to accommodate a move for us after the first night. The second room was larger than the first (which was appreciated), however it smelled like a previous guest had smoked in the room. The spa and mineral pools were fantastic! We were only able to dine at Solbar for breakfast, as we had made other arrangements for dinner. Breakfast was solid (albeit on the spendy side - $7.00 for an english muffin?). The staff is warm and very accommodating. We were greeted by name, which was a nice touch. I'm sure we'll be back!",
4,Good location and great room but service was a bit off,"My partner and I stayed there twice. After the first stay 18 months ago, we couldn’t wait to go back there. It was so perfect. But at the recent stay, I felt service was a bit off.

Prior to check-in this time, I asked a quiet room. But the first person who checked us in, she assigned a room right next to Brennan St.. It was noisy every time a car drove by even with all windows closed. So, we had to go back to the front desk to change the room. (The 2nd person who help us explained that the entire block of units in the west side were considered “quiet rooms”. I think they should review that since it was definitely not quiet.) But changing the room was smooth.

The room was very nice. Only what I felt missing were a hand shower, a double-sink and a view from a bath. Everything else was great.

For our room, there was only one bike for two of us. I called guest service and the person who I talked said that she will have someone bring another one by next morning, but the 2nd bike never arrived during our stay...

I enjoyed in-room breakfast very much. I never expected much from room service, but at the Solage, it was surprisingly delicious.

As for dinner, I probably don’t want to do dinner at Solbar again. Service was extremely slow, and food didn’t taste special.

Spa service was very good.

It would be great if the Solage provides a ride service to local businesses such as wineries and restaurants. Since it was too cold to walk or bike, we had to call Lyft/Uber to go to a local restaurant for dinner, which was kind of silly because it’s just 5 mins ride but the car had to drive up nearly 20 mins to get to the Solage.",
5,Luxurious Comfort,"We stayed one night during a wine country weekend. The room (actually a cabin) was large, comfortable, and luxurious (especially the bathroom). Location is an easy 2 mile walk or bike ride from downtown Calistoga, where we went for breakfast. Definitely try Calistoga Roastery -- amazing coffee!) If the weather had been warmer we would definitely have enjoyed sitting on the pretty patio in front of the cabin and tried out the free bikes waiting at the room. Loved the spa -- mudslide treatment was truly relaxing, and the jacuzzi was great after a long day of being out and about. This hotel was a splurge for us but we loved it!",
4,Lovely Getaway But Service Slipping,"We love Solage and have been going there a few times a year ever since they opened. It has everything from great rooms/cottages to a great spa and wonderful pools. Solbar, the restaurant, has very good food and it is nice not to have to leave the property for dinner. We really enjoy the fitness classes and the instructors are terrific. On this visit, however, the property seemed to be understaffed in all key areas, the front desk, the spa, and the restaurant. We called guest services five different times during our visit and the phone was never answered on three of them. On one of them, they recommended that an engineer come by our room and although we waited for over an hour, the person never showed up.
Each time that we called the spa to sign up for classes, we were put on hold for long periods of time, and when we went by in person to sign up, the staff was not helpful and appeared more interested in their computer screens even though we were the only people at the desk.
We also noted this lack of staffing in Solbar where dirty tables were left uncleared in the restaurant for a long period of time at a peak period (around 7pm). This was despite the fact that the staff that was there remained pleasant and were working very hard doing their best to get to everything. The food quality is still good, but not up to the standards of previous visits. Also, the class description for ""Yoga Hour"" should be ""Hot Yoga"" since they really heat up the room and we didn't know what we were getting into.
Despite all these things, we love staying at Solage and hope that they will fix the staffing issues before our next visit.",
5,Wonderful Wine Country base,"Stayed here the week between Christmas and New Years and highly recommend it. We felt like with 3 wineries booked each day and dinner out most nights we didn't get to make use of all the amenities the hotel offers. However we still very much enjoyed our stay. The cabins are great, very private, and love the complimentary water and sodas Each day as well as espresso machines. Great bath and shower , rooms are so nicely done. We did go to the adults only hot tub (pool sized) one afternoon and it was great. Also ate at restaurant once for dinner and once for brunch and both meals were
Excellent. Calistoga is a great base for exploring wine country and Solage was an excellent choice for us! Can't wait to come back!",
5,Another great review for Solage,"Even when it's raining, you can still enjoy your stay with heated pools and strong heaters in the cabanas. Wonderful trip. With the complimentary breakfast on the last morning, we were able to leave on a high note.",
5,Everything AND the kitchen sink!,"The Solage thought of everything, down to every detail! Guests are spoiled with having Solbar right on the premises - the food is truly exquisite! The Spa layout encourages complete relaxation, with their pool areas and various treatments and massage options! Having a complimentary vehicle courtesy of Mercedes-Benz is a huge bonus as well, being a stone's throw away from Yountville, Napa, Rutherford, St. Helena, etc. A getaway with guaranteed good eating and pampering is a much needed getaway for adventurous foodies! Staff is superb!",
5,A brief retreat,"The place is excellent, very clean, and rooms are spacious. They are pet friendly!! My Yorkie got his own bed, bowls for food and drink; and given treats and water.
It's a retreat from stressful everyday work with their mud baths, massage and facials. My adult kids love their sumptuous dinner of fish and steak.",
5,Weekend getaway,Solage is a fantastic venue and is located in a phenomenal location. The Solabe Bar is an enjoyable bar with great drinks and snacks and good people reconnecting with significant others. I highly recommend Solage.,
5,"Service is everything, Wine Country Must Stay!","They don't say no, everyone is friendly and helpful. We stayed over Valentines Day and could not be happier with Solage. Great value when you factor everything you get (free water/soda in mini frig, nesspresso machine, turn down service, access to pools/spa, free self parking and classes) big plus everything comes with a smile. I wanted to play guilt free golf and my wife was busy all day. Pack your bags and go! SolBar is great too. Forgot to mention the cottage is very spacious and private.",
4,Girls Weekend,"Solage Calistoga: Solage is the perfect escape- gorgeous architecture, comfiest beds ever, gorgeous spa, and amazing breakfast. Did I mention the amazing breakfast? We still talk about the lemon ricotta pancakes from 3 years ago and I'm glad they're still on the menu! This was our second girls getaway here and we can't wait to come back. Highly recommend a massage and spending some time in the giant hot tubs and steam rooms. Enjoy!",
4,Great get away while our daughter is a camp,"We have headed to Solage the past couple of summers while our daughter is away at camp. It is quiet, very private and comfortable. The location on Silverado Trail just outside of Calistoga is perfect. The spa facilities are nice. We did the ""mud"" treatment here expecting like Indian Springs does where you submerge in hot mud... this is a steam room with a each of you having a cup of mud... fun, but not the same. Overall a great place to stay. Great rooms, great food, nice bar... what more do you want!",
4,All the ingredients in place,"Fab place. finest pool in the land. Some of the downsides are east coast-types loudly discussing their sex lives from the pool to their mates sitting around the pool (seems teeth retainers are a problem) / group playing music (a woman asked them to turn it down, which they did but she was immediately 'where-you-fromd')
car borrowing is great, suggestions for vineyards fantastic / rooms and amenities are clean. the ""inclusive breakfast"" needs clarification of what can be spent to save embarrassment by asking.",
5,Birthday weekend,"We stayed only 2 nights as part of a birthday weekend celebration in March. We loved it, borrowed the bikes to go into town, enjoyed the mudslide treatment and the pool in the spa the most. It's not a cheap weekend, but you do feel pampered!",
5,Perfect way to ring in the New Year!,"We absolutely LOVED Solage! We had gone to the spa during our trip to Napa in December 2015 and decided to return to stay there for three nights on New Year's Eve 2016. Our room was large, spacious, and felt more like a private bungalow. The bathroom was divine although it did not have a bathtub. There is a lovely private patio where we saw 20+ quail running by one morning. The entire property is beautifully landscaped. I love that we could use the Solage bikes at our convenience. We had a ""Mud Slide"" at the spa, which we liked better than a traditional mud bath. The warm/hot pools are fantastic; we really like that there are clothing optional men's and women's pools, plus very large co-ed, lap-length swimming pools. The spa store is also nice. We had dinner at Solbar on New Year's Eve. When we made the reservation, we were told that it was a pre fixe dinner only. The food was good but we felt that the pre fixe price was rather high for what it was, and we noticed that other people had ordered from the regular menu, which we would have preferred to do, had we known that this was a possibility. When we have eaten there for lunch, and when we've had drinks and appetizers there, we thought it was excellent and fairly priced. Overall, it was a heavenly way to ring in the New Year!",
5,Perfect way to spend a birthday!,"Spent my birthday in Napa and stayed at the Solage in the Silverado Suite. We were drawn to the Solage / Silverado Suite because of the outdoor hot tub. We made great use of this each morning and evening! We had a temperature issue, but once addressed with management it was quickly resolved and the staff went out of their way to ensure that the rest of the trip was perfect. Their attention to detail was impressive. Despite its location in northern Napa, we didn't have to travel more than 35 minutes to any of the wineries or restaurants we visited. Side note -- January is a great time to visit, given the moderate temperature and the lack of crowds / traffic!",
3,What all the hype?,"I have been going to the spa here for a few years and told myself that one day I will stay here and not pay the $50 fee that they impose for non guest to use the spa. Finally this last month my brother was coming up for a visit for his b-day and so I booked some fun things to do and booked a room for the night. I have to say it was nothing special, in fact it was really kind of a disappointment. Granted the customer service of the desk staff, restaurant, and spa staff were great, but to pay over $800 a night for a room there it really wasn't worth it and not sure I would do it again. I thought that these rooms would be very luxurious, spacious, and quiet because they are cottages, but I was wrong. We had a two queen studio and they were comfortable, but nothing special about them. Instead of a closet there was a open walk in area to hang things up in. My brother said it reminded him of camp as kids, not a luxury hotel. It was raining so we didn't go outside on the patio. I expected that if the drapes were open to the patio that there would be some privacy, but learned quickly it just wasn't the case. I opened the drape when I woke up there were people standing on the other side of the bush 8 feet away talking and saw me standing there, so I shut the drapes. The rooms do look just as they appear online but I thought that they would feel more luxurious and not like camp. I should have looked more carefully. I was just really let down that there wasn't more to this stay then just an average room.",
5,Ah!!! This is BEST!!,"We spent Saturday night here for my Birthday! It was so worth it and we truly were so Relaxed!

The Silverado Suite: Now, I've been to Solage about 5 times. We have been in almost all of the rooms(Valley II Suite, Calistoga King Studio w/fireplace). The Silverado Suite is my FAVOIRITE!! Let's be clear. It will cost you! It's Luxury and worth it. It has it's own outside Jacuzzi tub and the jets are strong, cute patio, decent size soaking tub inside and a steam shower that you can spray eucalyptus oil while you use the steam plus a nice fireplace. So Relaxing and I highly recommend this suite. Great for a Relaxing Birthday or Special Occasion.

Sole Bar: Prices are Moderate - Pricey depending on what you order. Large French Pressed Coffee is $10.00 a pot. MY FAVORITE BREAKFAST IS THE LEMON RICOTTA PANCAKES! The Best Pancakes!! So delicious with the Blueberry syrup!!

Employees: All employees are Smiley and Friendly. They all seem to enjoy their jobs. I appreciate the Attentive Service!

So, if you're looking for a Relaxing and Luxurious place to stay, Solage is for you!!",
5,Restful and elegant get away,"Loved our stay. Relaxing, restful and private retreat. Would love to return sometime when the weather is conducive to utilizing the amenities. It rained the entire stay for us. Rooms are beautiful and and very private bungalows. Really enjoyed the solitude.",
4,Napa classic with amazing pool,"This is a pleasant resort with semi-nice cottages, exquisite cuisine and an amazingly oversized pool.
We loved the privacy of our little cottage, however the quality of the room was a bit on the low end. Cheap materials veiled in the promise of luxury. This, of course is a common observation in today's world, where one easily can get confused between cheap and modern. Plastic furniture is now called modern(cool), but really, it is just cheap plastic and after a few uses, when wear and tear takes a toll, not so cool.
The complimentary bicycles for every cottage are a great idea and we loved exploring the area on our own wheels.
The pool is gigantic and since I love swimming I was in heaven. However, the constant music was rather disturbing, especially one afternoon when a horde of girls booked one of the private cabanas and turned on their own hip-hop radio rather loudly, so we now had two different tunes blasting in our ears. When we inquired about this, we were told that since they paid( a ridiculously high amount)for their cabana, they were free to do whatever they wished. Not a good policy!
Dinner was a romantic and delicious affair and we also loved the boule court, very classy.",
5,OMG the mudslide with the sound chair!,"The mud body mask and the bath were fantastic, but the sound chair at the end was a new kind of experience. It was like I was dreaming but not sleeping. At the end I felt totally relaxed. Followed by a Michelin star lunch! The whole day was amazing.",
5,Lovely property,We stayed here for a long weekend and loved it. The rooms are very nice and the Spa is one of the prettiest I have ever seen. Room service was prompt and friendly. We stayed in a two queen Studio. Nice room and bathroom. They had a min frig stocked with water and soft drinks. Plus they had a coffee maker there for morning coffee. We would definitely stay again. Every staff person was friendly and helpful.,
4,Good place to relax in Napa,"Quality of the rooms, the pools and the spa is better than the appearance when someone arrives. Good heated outdoor swimming pool and very big spa. Bicycles available in each bungalow which is handy to go to Calistoga, very close by. If I was going to be out of the hotel most of the day to visit Napa, this is probably not the place. If you want to combine Napa visits with relax in your hotel, then this is a great choice, although not cheap. Minibar is free.",
5,Home Sweet Home,"This place feels more like home than my actual
Home. No joke. This place is everything and has everything. Delicious food at SolBar check the perfect spa check, dog friendly check divine room service at all times check best service and staff double check the best part it's the most relaxing place ever",
4,Not so impressed the second time around,"I still like their spa, it is the most impressive spa! The mineral pool is exquisite and at the right temperature. Floating in this large pool is life changing! They also have a small pool in women's section and men's section, but those are too hot to enjoy long term, even if the clothing is optional. The spa amenities are top notch, with tea, drinks, food, relaxation room, etc. the steam rooms are in each of the two sections - women and men and it is very clean and effective. They also have outdoor showered in those sections.

The rooms were very comfortable, while the beds were slightly on the harder side. The rooms are quiet as we stayed in self contained dwelling that host the bedroom and bathroom for each room. Bikes were provided for local exploration. The room had high quality organic shampoos and cream, that they also sell on the property, great quality coffees and teas, and a small fridge well stocked.

The breakfast was really great - we had the pancakes and duck confit. But the dinner was lacking. We agree that the food is well presented but very scant food is actually present on the plate. I enjoyed the atmosphere of the restaurant very much, with a centrally located fireplace and comfortable booths and nice decorations. But you may leave hungry after dinner.",
2,overated,"What a horrible disappointment ! The front desk provided no information on the property, no information on the restaurant, the spa, or the available Mercedes cars. You had to leave your room key behind to keep the room temperature constant. The 'soaking tub""' was a plain bathtub with no jets and only large enough for one. The ""cozy: fireplace was a small pot bellied stove with one burner like my range. The spa was blocks away (in 50'temps),and when we got there,(bicycles non-existant) the steam room was over 200' from the mineral pool, not a pleasant experience.",
5,Our 6th annual Holiday Visit...it only gets BETTER!!!,"Last month was our 6th annual stay at Solage for the Xmas holiday. Dinner at Sol-Bar Xmas Eve and Xmas Day brunch as well.
Our review only goes up from year to year.
Beautiful place, totally professional staff...and they DO love return guests.
Because the weather was cold, we requested cottages near to the restaurant, That worked perfectly. Accomodations for our two dogs worked beautifully. The area has many walkable paths to explore with our dogs,,,so they loved it also.
Food quality was superb. Room service lovely. Spa, althopugh more expensive this year, was excellent. We especially loved the hot pool with so many jets, every part of your body gets royal treatment.
Bravo Solage and Sol-Bar! You outdid yourselves!!",
4,New years stay,We really enjoy this resort - it is quiet and unassuming. Great place to disappear and rejuvenate.The restaurant is wonderful for breakfast and the spa treatments are some of the best we receive anywhere. We like Auberge properties! We stayed two nights and had a room with a hot tub which for us is the best - I'd prefer to use the big pools at night but understand it's too difficult to manage security in those but I do love that. As with all Auberge properties the customer services is wonderful!,
4,We've stayed at Solage numerous times and it may have slipped a little,"I'm not sure it was the time of year (though we've been for New Years several times) or the transition but things slipped a little for us this year at Solage. We did not feel quite as special as in the past - restaurant service was great sometimes but not great other times. The Chai tea was empty, the cleaning crew came too early, the spa was seemingly not super flexible. These slight imperfections were felt acutely as they did not exist at Meadowood in the days before. Also, this might sound bad but there were way too many children at the resort - they were everywhere! Part of the allure of Napa for us is that it is a place to get away and it felt quite a bit less away this time...",
3,Slightly lacking,"This was the 3rd time my husband and I visited Solage and I have to say, our previous stays had been a much better experience. Upon check in we were not given the standard welcome glass of wine. I kept looking at the bottles but the front desk gentleman didn't catch my hint. When we got to the room I called and mentioned this and they did apologize and bring two small glasses to the room. Our previous stays were in the spa suite which was unfortunately unavailable so we booked the deluxe king room with fireplace. It had a teeny tiny fire place and in my opinion was a bit stuffy and small. We had a view of the Main Street and the room itself was sort of like a free standing box. The only window was the sliding glass doors. My spa experience was not great. I do LOVE the heated spring fed pool and the facilities are quite lovely. My masseuse had me get prepared and once I was on the table ready upon his return he told me he had put me in the wrong room. I got redressed and switched rooms and then waited 10 minutes for him as he, my guess, fixed the room he accidentally put me in.
We ate a the the Michelin star restaurant for dinner. I felt the food was good but a little bland and uninteresting.
Having stayed at all the Auberge resorts in Napa I would say this is by far my least favorite and lacking the high service and charm the others have. I did enjoy my previous stays with the spa suite but the standard rooms just left me cold.",
4,Very Nice But Could Be Better,"This is a very nice, quiet resort with a friendly staff, with one exception. Our room was beautiful and the setting is very peaceful. The spa experience was terrific, and the pools and facilities are wonderful. The food and drinks in Solbar are fantastic. Unfortunately, there is a distinctly pretentious, if not arrogant, attitude among some of the staff in Solbar that diminishes the overall friendliness of the resort. However, the highlight of Solbar is Bridget, who saved our experience. She is absolutely the best server.",
5,"Beautiful, attentive and relaxed","Got a great rate and thoroughly enjoyed the hotel, spa, and restaurant. Rooms are spacious and well appointed, staff are attentive and eager to assist, and the restaurant provided an excellent tasting menu, will return soon.",
4,Beautiful setting but watch the extras,"We got a very good price through Trip Advisor and enjoyed our stay even eating in their hatted restaurant one night which wasn't much pricier than most of the good restaurants in Calistoga. The geothermal springs are acccessible for guests but the Solage spa is very pricy .

The resort includes a lot of useful items including robes and slippers at the bathhouse. The rooms have soft drinks included in the mini bar and also provide coffee and tea making facilities plus chocolates and iced water with the turn down.",
4,Nice getaway,"Our stay at Solage was wonderful. The property is tucked away in a very quiet part of town and it's the ultimate place for wine country relaxation. Our room was very clean, modern and comfortable with a nice patio. The entire place smells like lavender which as you can imagine is very relaxing. The only odd thing was that there was a random refrigerator near the entrance of our room which we think was because the mini bar fridge was broken? Not sure. It took away a little from the charm of the room. But overall the rooms are very nice and quaint. The best part of Solage is probably their spa. The facilities are large and spacious and one of my favorite spa experiences. I would come back just to enjoy their spa again. We also ate at their onsite restaurant Solbar and the food was very good and had a great vibe to it. Although we do wish that there were more options for food spots at the resort. Overall though it was a great stay and we would definitely go back.",
5,Understated luxury but feels like home,First off we loved the rooms. The open layout and style. Felt like a small house and just very comfortable. Wonderful onsite restaurant that works hard to offer healthy options. Great service even when we wanted bar service at the pool late in the evening. Well trained staff. Spa is also very nice and love the geothermal pool. A great home base the enjoy the area or just have a spa/pool day with your loved one.,
4,Clean bungalows with great staff,"My only negative is that some bungalows/ cottages are not shown to be easily accessible by car. The bungalows are arranged like a maze and the signage is awful at night. The rooms are nice and the housekeeping and front office helpful when asked. Unfortunately at check in one isn't given a real explanation of the hotel and what it offers. Ex. A Mercedes you can check out, etc",
5,Lovely to visit in December,"We were offered a deal online for a winter visit and decided to spring for it. December does not have the best weather in the Napa Valley, but we loved the quiet. The resort was mostly empty, so it was extremely peaceful and relaxing. The onsite restaurant is great and the breakfasts were delicious. This may not be the ideal time of year to visit from out of state, but if you're in the Bay area, it's a great place to go for a quiet few days away.",
5,Great Place to Stay,There are endless places to stay in Napa, up and down the valley. This is my new favorite place to stay. I have stayed in placed in Yountville and have stayed at some great places. The website for Solage does not do it justice. I thought it would be more sparse. The hotel is understated simple luxury. The rooms are just as nice as Bardesonno. My wife enjoyed the spa and she loved it. The gym is large and has lots of equipment. Had breakfast and lunch at the restaurant. Breakfast - you have to have the donut holes. The lunch is legendary.
5,Great Spa,My wife and I were at the spa on November 16 and it had the best massages ever. The entire experience was worthwhile and we wished we lived closer so we could go there more often. Absolutely 100 percent recommend the spa.,
4,Lovely Spa Relaxing Stay,"The Solage is an exceptionally expensive resort, one would expect service and attention to detail to be five star. The resort is lovely, however several things could have been better during our stay. The room unfortunately was difficult to navigate, the bathroom didn't provide much privacy. (We also had a problem with spiders coming in from a bent door frame.) The ipad was a great touch, however it was never explained to use that it's used to request most services throughout our stay. Our spa packages felt a bit rushed, and the services were provided in reverse order, also the ""extras"" that came with the package were not provided. The front desk had exceptional clerks, and bell service was also great. Dining was very delicious in the Solbar restaurant, top notch. Room service was a bit disappointing, as food arrived cold. I think the resort is experiencing transitional issues, I would go back again once the ownership changes are completed.",
5,Very Nice Spa,"We took our friends from Hk her for two nights and we all loved it even with the rain. The 50-yd heated pool was fantastic. The mineral pool was great. And their restaurant, Solbar, was excellent. Our friends, who are quite picky about restaurant, were impressed. We'll be back again and soon.",
5,Great Hotel,"This place is fantastic!!! The rooms are to die for and they are chock full of amenities. The food at their restaurant, Solbar, is wonderful. Furthermore, each staff member at the bar and restaurant made wonderful recommendations based on my desires. Solage also has an exercise room with a large assortment of equipment, and the hold several workout classes each day - oh and each room has bicycles for a relaxing ride into downtown Calistoga. Their spa is wonderful and they even have expertise in prenatal - happy wife :-) I HIGHLY recommend this hotel - I will definitely be back.",
5,Top Notch,"My husband and I split our trip between Napa and Calistoga. We thoroughly enjoyed the Solage! Being later in October, there were no crowds to speak of (plus the rain may have kept them away!). The hotel in general was very quiet. The grounds are well kept -- we saw gardeners working even in the rain. Our room was towards the back and was quiet and clean. We had cocktails at SolBar the first night and had our dinner there the next night. Both experiences were great -- the staff was courteous and professional. Unfortunately we didn't get to enjoy the pool but it looked gorgeous and I'd imagine it would be awesome on a warm sunny day. We rode our bikes into town for breakfast one morning....it's a great way to explore the local community! All in all it was a great experience and I'd love to return someday",
5,A honeymoon visit to the spa,"This place is spectacular! Accommodations are private and very nice with all the amenities you would expect (an expensive place to stay however). All of the staff was very helpful and my wife and I enjoyed all of the spa activities including couples mudbaths, which we highly recommend. We added 3 days to our initial stay because we enjoying the relaxing soothing atmosphere. Go there for a wonderful rejuvenation.",
4,Fun place to stay!,"My fiance took me hotel hopping for my birthday so we started off at Calistoga Ranch and ended up at Solage for the latter part of the trip. I'm glad we were able to try out both hotels because one was romantic and rustic, whereas Solage was livelier and busy.

The Solage rooms are lovely; they're like little bungalows that opens to the outside wooded area. Each room comes with 2 bikes, so we were able to take advantage of it around the resort. The bed was comfy, bathroom was lovely and the room came with a wonderful bottle of wine.

We also tried Solbar for breakfast - food was great, service was okay, ambiance was meh. It took a really long time to give our order, but our server was apologetic. The atmosphere felt super stuffy - we overheard a patron demanding to order something from the brunch menu when it was already past breakfast time. We were seated by a table next to the older couple, and it felt extremely awkward when they demanded, complained and whined about wanting specific pancakes because they ""always have to have the pancakes"". I don't think I would patron the restaurant just because of the weird, stuffy ambiance that caters to an older crowd. Surprisingly, when we patroned the restaurant at Calistoga Ranch, the ambiance was so much better.

Overall, I would probably go back to Calistoga Ranch over Solage, but it was still a wonderful, fun experience.",
5,Terrific spot!,"So enjoyed staying at Solage. Linens are off the charts! The little things....bicycles for two by your door, make your own coffee, etc. Nice grounds, private patios. Just a really well throughout hotel. Highly recommend!",
5,Kind of like glamping but WAY fancier,"This place is amazing. I sort of felt like I was at a campground with my only little fancy cabin. This place is fancy, yet not stuffy by any means. It's really perfect. The bikes outside your ""cabin"" were a nice little touch. We rode to breakfast and then to wine tasting at Brian Arden (highly recommend you visit!)

The spa was also great, and it was so nice to sit by the pool and order great food.

Don't hesitate to book here. I will definitely be back.",
5,Wonderful Stay!,"We stayed here for a long weekend for a friends wedding. The hotel was beautiful! The services was impeccable! The room itself was beautiful and cozy. The pool was wonderful and the service was fantastic! The gym was great as well.
Everything was perfect and the staff was great.
We definitely would return again.",
5,"Peaceful, Relaxing, Private, Romantic","What a wonderful experience. Solage Calistoga provided a fantastic Napa experience. The rooms are large, private, and have wonderful amenities like their own patio, fireplace, and amazing shower. The restaurant and bar are both excellent. The gym is very well equipped, and there are a wide variety of exercise classes available. The resort also provides all guest with bicycles they can borrow to make the short trip in to Calistoga, as well as several vehicles that can be borrowed at no cost for up to 4 hours for a longer trip. We had a delightful stay.",
5,Best Massage Ever,"After three days of cycling through the wine country, I was fortunate to have a wonderful deep tissue massage from Cindy. I've had massages all over the world, and Cindy was the best. Our meals at Sol Bar were excellent also.",
1,Don't Assume This Place Is 5 Star - Far from it!,"We are very frequent travelers (1 trip per week) and stay at 4 and 5 star hotels and resorts on all of our trips. 99% of the time, we have a very favorable experience. This resort was one of the worst run resorts we have experienced and one of the most expensive resorts at that. I highly recommend looking for alternatives. There are plenty of great places to visit in the Napa region that will surely delight.

Because we understand the impact a negative review can have, we wanted to allow the resort to respond directly to us. We filled out a detailed customer satisfaction survey that was administered by the resort. We received no call or email acknowledging or addressing our concerns. I then took it upon myself to send a message to management about our experience and again no response at all.

• They claim to have a Michelin chef with amazing food. We dined several times during our trip at the resort and there was no meal that was even a 2-star caliber. The quality of ingredients were subpar using basic store bought breads and even their simple appetizers like chicken sliders were frozen prepared sloppily prepared. We ordered simple pizza and I am not exaggerating when I say that the pizza came out raw. Literally, the pizza dough was white with no hint of brown anywhere. The sauce tasted exactly like ketchup. We had short ribs for dinner which was very average – not extremely tender nor flavorful.
• We ordered room service on the first afternoon and we placed the trays outside our door as we were instructed. The food and trays remained outside of our door for our entire stay. As we carried our luggage out of the room, the ant infested trays still sat outside of our door.
• When we checked into our room, there was no running water. We found that for some reason, all of the water entering our room was turned off.
• Although the staff was extremely nice, they were clearly not trained or aware of how to accommodate guests. They worked very hard and were very very good people who treated us with respect, but were not coordinated or trained on how to serve. It gave us the feel that the property was brand new which it certainly is not.
• We should have known that we may have problems because when we attempted to book our rooms, we were given many different answers about the rates and whether we needed to stay a minimum number of nights. We were told that we were required to stay the entire 3 day holiday weekend and could not just stay 2 nights. Then, they told me they would speak with management and call me back. They never called back. I then called and spoke with another person only to get a different answer. This took place 3 times. In every instance, they did not call me back as promised. I had to call them and start the process over again.
• Finally, considering my attempts to contact and provide feedback directly to management with no response at all, is extremely telling relative to the importance they place on customer satisfaction.

In summary, to charge an average of $700 per night, you better create a decent experience for your guests. In retrospect, I would not pay more than $130 per night at this resort and that price would assume the issues mentioned above did not happen again. The food was by far the worst part especially in contrast to how they promote themselves with the Michelin Chef banner.

We hope this helps others as they consider spending top $ in Napa.",
5,bike trip to Napa,"Solace was terrific. Great food, service + facilities. Loved it. Beautiful scenery. Every room has 2 bikes to ride into town on. The fitness center was well equipped. The pool was lovely. We were on a bike trip in Napa Valley with Backroads and spent 3 nights at Solace...would have been happy to be there seven nights.",
5,Best Meal Ever!,If you have a chance to stay at the Solage...do it! Do it and make sure you have dinner while you there. All 15 of us enjoyed our 5 star dinner and the 5 star cocktails!! The wait staff was more than attentive making this a very enjoyable evening!,
4,Use the thermal pool.,"Very nice stay. O need to take sunscreen, they provide you with such. A nice complimentary bottle of wine. Peaceful and luxurious. Nothing extraordinary mind-blowing, but if you want romance and relaxation, this is a good place to be.",
5,Peaceful and Lovely,"Solage Calistoga is a fabulous base from which to explore Napa. The grounds are exquisite, and the rooms are large, clean and comfortable. The restaurant is excellent and the gym is well-equipped. Both the spa and the exercise classes were first rate. Overall, the staff was incredibly attentive without being obsequious. But what we liked the most was the peacefulness - our cabin (#14) was quiet and serene and we were able to relax completely.",
5,It Doesn't Get any Better!!!,"Having stayed virtually everywhere in the wine country, I believe that I will always stay at Solage in the future. Meadowood and Auberge are wonderful , but they are often $ 1,500/ night. I can't rationalize that when I spend 8 hours in the room- $ 200/ hour. Solage has individual houses very well equipped . I especially appreciate the real coffee maker, grinder and beans. The resort has a great spa and a conventional pool fed by mineral springs. Every moment that I'm not wine tasting , I'm in the pool. Wonderfully exhilarating . I can't really remember the rate, but it is under $ 500 / night, maybe significantly. The resort has a Mobil 3-star (I think) restaurant, a little too fancy for me, but very good. Eating at the bar is the best option. It's just that there are so many great restaurants in the wine country that it's hard to eat there except for snacks at the bar. My highest recommendation . Don't miss this one !!",
3,Nice but not fabulous,"The property was nice but not as nice as I'd expect for an Auburge. Same with the room, food and service.

The in-room fireplace was itty bitty. Large bathroom.
The rooms lacked privacy- Ours was too close to the restaurant and the porch faced other back porches. But as I looked around, I did not see any rooms that had a private porch. Most or all of the porches faced the courtyards so there were no views nor privacy. There were hedges but in my opinion, they should rearrange the property.

We did have a nice waitress at Solbar. And we did like having cruiser bikes available for a ride into Calistoga (Bella Bakery) and around the nearby bike trail and vineyards.

The pool was nice. Moritz (at the pool) seemed to be on point, but our waiter was not. In my opinion, It is worth the $ to go to Calistoga Ranch where the scenery, pool, privacy, hospitality, food and even the bikes are much nicer.",
5,amazing Solage!,"Solage offers everything a visitor of this Californian wine region can ask for.
from arrival to departure we enjoyed every moment. the large rooms and private patio area are extremely comfortable. The restaurant serves delicious food, a good selection for breakfast and dinner and the bar has nice food too. Breakfast has a large variety of healthy options and is one of the best we have come across in California.
top!",
5,Solage Calistoga,This is a great place to call home while visiting Napa Valley. Rooms were very simple and comfortable. The town of Calistoga is very warm and inviting. We took an afternoon and drove into the city of Napa to check it out and SO thankful we did not stay anywhere in that city. The Valley and especially Calistoga is so much more peaceful!,
4,Property and Gorgeous and Spa is Crowning Jewel,"We stayed here for just one night, but it was lovely. The accommodations are very nice, our room wasn't as large or well appointed as a ""typical"" Auberge room, but it was still really nice. While pretty quaint, we had everything we needed. We paid extra for a tub and fireplace, but both were small and nothing that special. In my opinion geothermal pools you have access to as a resort guest are awesome and replace the need for a tub in your own. The provided bike are a fun and easy way to get around the property.

The spa is great! Awesome array of services and very spacious. I wish the staff had been better about enforcing the calm/serene vibe, however. There was a very loud group of women making a lot of noise the whole time. There is a pool on the other end of the property and I think that is a more appropriate place for that noise.

Overall, the quality of food was disappointing on property. You can see my review of Solbar for more info. We also ordered smoothies at the spa and they were full of sugar and purees instead of the fresh seasonal ingredients we expected. We have stayed at many Auberge properties and other properties in the Napa Valley area and the food quality did not measure up.

We would return again to enjoy the spa, but will probably try other places in the area first in search of larger rooms and better food.",
5,3rd review- still a gorgeous place,"This is our first stay at the Solage and still think it an awesome property. Out first stay, about 4 years ago, was a rave; everything beginning to end was flawless, plus it was our first stay in a high end Napa hotel; 2nd time- 2 years ago- all seemed to have gone wrong, from the checking experience, to the dining, the service; With much reluctance we decided to book the 3rd time- honestly, Napa was sold out- all the good properties we discovered in between (Yountville Hotel, Auberge du Soleil, Carneros Inn, Bardessono) were booked solid and Solage had a room...so we risked it. We booked the Mercedes package which is great value, if you own a Mercedes (we were never asked for proof of ownership :)) Solage remains a good overall complete offering; we did the spa journey, dined and lunched, and enjoyed the beautiful pools, even test drove a Bentley convertible; service was predictably good. awesome gateway that still competes in top 3 resorts in the valley.",
5,Such a restful experience,"We visited Solage a few years ago, that time we stayed Fri-Mon, noticing how quiet it was Sunday afternoon/Monday morning we decided that our next visit would be during the week. We visited Labour Day through to the Friday. We were fortunate, it was quiet so the experience was a big chill for us. We stayed in a King Studio and appreciated the size and the amenities that come with that room. We spent quite a bit of time by the pool where Moritz did a great job keeping the service going. On the whole the service was very good except for a couple of glitches with housekeeping. We used the bikes to go into town and to wineries. We borrowed the convertible Merc which was great fun. We had a couples massage in the Spa. It was a bit of a treat, we didn't maximise the use of the mineral pools as it was so warm. It would be a nice thing to do when the temperatures were cooler. The pool is the biggest draw for me and it is the pool that brought us back and probably will do again. We had a couple of breakfasts and one dinner in Solar. Breakfast was the better experience. A bonus was a cheese platter and bottle of wine left in our room as the restaurant and bar were closed one evening for maintenance. It was a nice touch. Location wise the hotel is close enough to walk into town in the evening. We enjoyed our experience once again",
5,Labor Day Weekend,World class service. The team at Solage have a care and passion that made the stay very special. Highly recommend. From the pool staff to the amazing service at the restaurant and you will be hard pressed to find a comparable experience in the Napa valley.,
4,Relaxing modern resort,"We don't normally go for resort type places, but after a few days in hectic San Francisco the Solage made a very relaxing contrast. It is close to the small town of Calistoga which was handy for shopping, several simple restaurants and numerous vineyards when we wanted to get away from the resort atmosphere, which made it a great location. The Solage itself is lovely, very relaxed, most of the staff are excellent and it is very well maintained with gardening, pool and housekeeping staff especially doing a great job. Nice modern studio room with a sitting area outside. We enjoyed the complimentary classes and gym, and the beautiful pool area and Spa as well as less healthy pursuits of Wine tasting and eating at the several good nearby restaurants (solbar on site, auberge du soleil and calistoga ranch a short drive away). Overall a very relaxing and pleasant stay.",
3,Very nice but lacking,"I cannot say anything really negative but I cannot give Solage a great review either. It just was fine and very nice but never felt special or warmth or a feeling they were glad we were there. Robotic and efficient and clean but not worth going back. Just not a friendly place and staff were polite but not friendly. Guests were a little stuck on themselves. As a successful person I don't see why success and money makes you a snob. Lots of snobs with probably a lot less money then they act like here. Just not a warm welcoming friendly place honestly. Won't go back. Other 5 star places close by that might care if I stay there or not much more.
I heard management was poor from a former employee at a winery and I understand. Very corporate not very good.",
5,Lovely relaxed place,"Excellent staff Lovely room - toiletries smell amazing! Spa is stunning, especially the relaxation room Great food We loved using the bikes to explore Calistoga Service by the pool is really great - provide water and fresh towels regularly without being intrusive",
5,Total gem in the north end of the Napa Valley,"We had the pleasure of staying in Calistoga as we were attending a wedding at a winery nearby. We had visited the spa before which was totally fab (both the services and the pool) and always knew that we wanted to come back for a stay. The visit exceeded our expectations... the pool is amazing with very attentive service. There's something about the mountain setting in the background and the palm trees that make the place magical. Aside from the pool, we made use of the gym facilities which are also quite nice for hotel standards. And we ate breakfast at Solbar twice which was delicious. The room was very comfortable even if it wasn't super interesting. We really enjoyed the large shower.",
5,Birthday Celebration,Great stay at this beautiful resort on the Silverado Trail. The rooms were nice and they had wine and champagne set up for us on arrival. The service was great. We enjoyed the pool and spa services. Everyone was accommodating and ready to help us.,
5,Relaxing escape,"I came here on my own and had such a comfortable, relaxing time. I didn't have a car and so loved the free bikes to take a 5 min ride to town and to cycle to the wineries. The pools were lovely, rooms very comfortable and the services excellent. Had a great fun.",
4,Service glitches almost overcome,"My wife and I just got home after a two night stay at Solage, on the tail end of a two week trip in California. Make no mistake, this is an excellent hotel with high end features, including nice rooms, a beautiful pool for lap swimming, a nice spa & hot mineral pools (including clothing optional choices), and a good gym. They also have an excellent restaurant which I will review separately (Solbar). All of that being said, we felt let down by some significant service glitches at the beginning of our stay involving non delivered luggage which was left in the trunk of our car and slow responses on several other items. Other then that it was fine, but sometimes a bit pro forma from the mostly very young staff. This was generally okay even as it was a bit lacking in character and soul, but when you are spending $800 plus per night you might expect a bit more warmth, graciousness, and professionalism. On balance, it wouldn't keep me from staying here again if I wanted to be in Calistoga, but it is leading to my rating of four stars instead of five.",
5,Charming retreat in the heart of Calistoga,"We come here every winter for a couple's getaway and it is the perfect reprieve from busy NYC life! The spa packages are our favorite deals, as we love to enjoy the mineral bath pools, massages, and other spa treatments. The service is really top notch, from the spa to the restaurant. The little individual cottages give you tons of privacy, are beautifully appointed with lovely spa-like toiletries, and we especially like the rooms that come with a fireplace. I had to request a firmer mattress one time as I woke up with the most excruciating back pain on their soft bed, but they were able to change it out the next morning with no questions asked. We love the fact that you get a bicycle for your use during your stay (we rode to the Old Faithful geyser and past some wineries, though we didn't drink and bike!). They also have a few cars to borrow if you are without one.

We are big fitness people and they actually offer a nice array of classes. It's hard to get into the pilates class, but I even took my husband to a barre class with me (he is very patient), and the cardio/weight equipment is decent. The grounds are really beautiful and serene. There is tons of parking and you can walk/bike to the little village with shops and restaurants. The packages got a little pricier this year, but I expect we will be back at some point.",
5,"Wonderful experience at hotel, spa and restaurant","I stayed here for a weekend in March with a group of friends. The grounds were beautiful and the rooms were spacious. We enjoyed the free bikes to ride around the resort and even went to town one day via bike. Sometimes it's the little things that matter, and the high quality in room coffee, in a canister to measure to one's liking, was a welcome sight. We had brunch at Sol Bar. Delicious. At the spa, we each had one spa treatment plus the spa's mudslide experience. All fantastic. The only comment we had on the spa, was there seemed to be few attendants in the common areas of the spa, such as the bar and pool area.",
5,"Wonderful, relaxing getaway","My husband received a Solage gift card, so we decided to spend two nights and enjoy the resort. So glad that we did. It's just outside downtown Calistoga in the midst of vineyards and beautiful views of the California hills. There are five pools, three are hot mineral water and one is Olympic size for real swimming and another for families with children. There is also a full service spa with hot mineral and mud baths, massages, exercise, etc. and two bocce ball courts.
Your living unit comes with two cruiser bicycles and there is a fleet of four Mercedes available at no extra charge for guests. We had #4 which was a double queen and was quite large with a private covered patio and huge bathroom with a soaking tub and walk in shower with pebble floor. Also a large bar with a fridge, coffee maker, electric tea kettle and a full complement of liquor, wines, champagne, snacks etc for purchase.
The beds are extremely comfortable with high end bedding, down pillows and duvets.
All of the staff were very friendly and helpful, making us feel special and welcome. The atmosphere is completely laid back and Solage is the perfect place to relax and get away from the hectic SF Bay Area.
It's expensive, but you do get a lot for your money.",
5,Solage is one of my favorites!,Have stayed at Solage a few times and I am never disappointed! I love the geo thermal mineral pool- Perfection! The hamburger and fries are out of this world delicious! Fabulous Spa! Attentive staff! Enjoy!,
5,"Zen environment surrounded by vineyards, in casitas with full resort experiences","Solage is away from most of the towns in Napa which means it is quieter and more rustic It is a 5 star resort with a huge pool, a great spa and a kitchen that rates Michelin stars. the rooms are separate casitas and they provide bicycles for each room. It is easy to visit many wineries and do active things in the area, If you want to be nearer the towns like St Helena or Yountville the ride is maybe 15-20 minutes. Go during the week or during promotion times or the price can be pretty steep.",
5,Pure relaxation and pleasure,"I felt like I was a world away in an enclave of pure pleasure and relaxation. The grounds are beautiful, the staff was top notch while being friendly and down to earth. The spa was exceptional. The food was amazing. The word NO is NOT in their vocabulary.",
4,Very nice lunch --either inside or outside,"Very friendly and helpful service. Nice outside shaded eating area (as well as inside) Very good double cheeseburger, baby back ribs, fried green tomatoes. OK falafel sandwich. Nice chicken fingers for children. About $100 for four adults and two small children. A nice alternative to many Napa Valley tourist lunch places. This review is not reviewing the hotel.",
5,Wow wonderful!,"This place is like a slice of heaven. The rooms are every simple, but elegant and soothing. I like that they have two bikes by your front door so you can take off exploring the grounds, or go less than one Mile to the cute downtown of Calistoga. I couldn't leave without buying a bottle of the cleanser and lotion. The geo-thermal pool was wonderful. The big pool was also great, but beware if you do laps it's long!!!! It's almost Olympic size.",
5,Amazing experience!,This is one of my top 3 places I visit every year. I come away relaxed and refreshed. I come for a weekend and leave wondering why I never plan to stay longer. It truely is that great that you wish you didn't have to leave! I love spending time here during the holidays here as they make me feel right at home.,
5,Romantic birthday trip,"This place was a paradise for me. My partner and I always wanted to stay here ever since we dropped by Solbar for lunch. Our stay was actually so perfect.

Our guest room was spacious, beautiful and comfortable. The restaurant was delicious for both lunch and dinner. There are multiple pools and hot tubs to hang out. Spa treatments were fun. There is a nice studio to walk out. (There is a gym though we didn't use it.) There were two bikes designated to each guest room.

In October, San Francisco was cool, but Calistoga was gorgeously warm. The difference was so nice. It was absolutely wonderful to hang out by pool side, eat breakfast at a terrace and cycle around the area feeling warm air.",
4,Provided the relaxation we needed!,"Fabulous property - loved the style. Our room was brilliant - not OTT but with lots of thoughtful touches. Enjoyed the grounds, the open fire pits, watching humming birds and using the cycles.

We had the couples mudslide, my husband the best massage of his life and I had a fantastic facial. Along with a soak in the mineral pool, it was the perfect wind-down start to our holiday.

We ate breakfast in the restaurant which was excellent, but couldn't book a table for dinner - apparently they reserve two tables for each booking, so that guests can choose whether to dine indoors or outdoors when they get there. We would have been flexible, so were quite disappointed. (Did mean that we tried Sams though - which we loved!) We returned for after dinner drinks, and the whole place was very busy with slow service. The restaurant's efficiency seems to revolve around the presence of a very effective manager - when he turned up part way through our breakfast service the next day, the whole pace of service increased by a couple of gears.

We enjoyed using the pool and sun loungers, and the staff there were very helpful.

There was an issue with a future hotel booking, and the front desk staff spent a lot of time trying to help us.

Would definitely return - just disappointed that we weren't able to enjoy the Solbar fully whilst we were there.",
4,Great Weekend Get Away,"Cute resort with private cottages that's great for a romantic weekend get away to get out of the hustle and bustle of Bay Area life. We visited in April for my husband's 35th birthday. Each cottage is assigned two bikes for the duration of your visit. The property is pretty spread out so they came in handy when needing to get across property quickly if you didn't want to walk or move your car. Our room was well appointed, however, the closet space/storage was tiny (not a huge deal). Room service was blah and we were not impressed. So many great restaurants in the area, we were surprised that the room service food was so bad as it came from the same kitchen as their highly recommend onsite restaurant. My husband also had a massage at the spa which he throughly enjoyed and he said the spa was very nice. Would recommend this place.",
5,Beautiful Place for an outdoor Wedding.,The staff is excellent. The food was tasty. The setting is idyllic. I loved the fact that each room is a private cabin. Attention was paid to every detail. Even the valet parking was excellent. I do not have one thing to complain about except the 100 degree temperature and I don't think I can blame that one them. This is much less commercialized than Napa.,
5,Romantic Anniversary Get Away,"My wife and I wanted to celebrate our wedding anniversary in the California Wine Country. We chose Solage in Calistoga and could not be happier that we did so. The service was professional, courteous and personal. The food (brunch and dinners) was exquisite. And the Spa services bordered on the decadent. We came back relaxed, rejuvenated and very happily in love. Thank you, Solage.",
5,As close to perfect as it gets,"Great experience from start to finish. Prior to our arrival, Jason, one of the concierge, set up an amazing private winery tour(private car, wineries I had requested). The rooms are actually private bungalows, all very private and quiet. Our room was cozy modern and well appointed with free coffee and tea. The spa facilities and treatments were AMAZING! Excellent gym, free fitness classes. All the staff members were friendly and attentive. We are looking forward to returning!",
3,not quite perfect,"This is a fairly nice resort but there were a couple of things they could do to make the place superb.
When I booked the hotel, I made a point of requesting a quiet room as I am a light sleeper and a big part of getting away was to get some R and R. We arrived on our first night after 8 pm and was first led to the wrong area of the resort so after unloading all our bags, we had to load them all up and drive to the right area. We immediately noticed the noise from the highway and I reminded our escort that I had asked for a quiet room. And the young woman helping us seemed to understand and yet, our room was about as close to the main road as possible. As we got in so late and had dinner reservations at the restaurant, we quickly unpacked and had dinner. Our first night sleep was terrible due to the noise from the road so I went to speak to the front desk staff the following day and we were moved much farther from the road which greatly improved our sleep the next two nights. I was grateful they moved us but given I had noted the quiet room request when I booked our stay and also called and reiterated my request, I have to wonder about their attention to detail. This was the only request I made for our stay. I called on our second day to ask about making a long distance call from the room and despite asking and waiting 10 minutes, I was told by the front desk staff member that she wasn't able to find this information for me.
The spa and pool areas are gorgeous and so is the restaurant.
The resort has many positive attributes but it doesn't have the level of service I expect from a first rate property.",
5,Perfect weekend get away,"Solage is a first class weekend retreat in a quiet corner of Napa Valley. I highly recommend this to any visitor. The service is great, the accommodations are relaxing and romantic. The staff treat you as if you are a guest in their home. SolBar service and food are indicative of their Michelin star. We tried a wide variety of dishes and everything was amazing.",
5,Unique property and service exceeded expectations,"The Solage exceeded already-high expectations; would recommend the resort for a unique and memorable stay.

Pros:
---staff is personable and professional; they went out of their way to anticipate and meet requests. We felt welcomed and pampered.
---fun and complimentary mercedes loaner program is just one example of the several one-of-a-kind perks on offer. There is no catch ... just let them copy your driver's license, sign a form, and drive away in one of their on-site vehicles (including a convertible) for a tour around the valley
---the ""suites"" are self-contained cottages with plenty of room; great ground coffee for the coffeemaker and mint water and chocolates at turndown ... and comfortable beds and bedding
---the fitness center is huge and well appointed; the spa is a large multi-building area with its own pool that is more secluded and quiet than the main resort pool. Hotel guests have complimentary access to the spa area (such as the steam room, outdoor showers, and spa pool)
---no extraordinary upcharges / no nickel and diming

Cons:
---the resort and restaurant wouldn't be considered a ""value"" experience ... our breakfast for two at solbar was $75 and the mudslide treatment for two is $220
---the architecture, landscaping, and interior design features/fixtures are similar to an apartment complex in texas ... I'm sure it's intentional, but the minimalist approach doesn't seem to match the high room rates ... and some of the fixtures in the rooms are definitely of lower quality. We even wondered if the resort was originally built as an apartment complex or retirement home but redesigned/reconfigured at some point.
---no sauna in the locker rooms

Tips:
---for restaurants, we enjoyed R+D in yountville and Sushi Mambo in calistoga
---visit blackbird for shopping in town
---make sure you take advantage of the on-site convertible loaner",
5,Great start to a honeymoon!,"Calistoga is such a beautiful place and staying at Solage was a wonderful experience. Loved the separate little living quarters. Very zen, very private. Excellent service. (Awesome coffee to brew in the room.) We loved having the bikes to use and rode into town for breakfast. I would highly recommend!",
5,Wonderful 50th Birthday Celebration,"Everything about this property is special and unique! We love the bikes that you can ride around the property, the spa is beautiful and peaceful and the restaurant is outstanding. It is in a perfect location. Calistoga is nice b/c you are a little bit removed from the business of the Napa Valley.",
5,Amazing,"This hotel has hit the nail on my the head for a quick getaway in the hart of the Napa valley wine country. From amenities to food to bikes so you can get around this beautiful property, this hotel has it all. It is also just minutes from bustling downtown Calistoga.",
5,Great Getaway,"Snagged my daughter for a quick Sunday afternoon/night stay for Mother's Day. Easy drive up the valley with a stop at Chandon in Yountville before cutting over to the Silverado Trail to avoid St. Helena traffic. Arrived in time for pre-spa lunch at Solbar, which never disappoints. Thereafter, we both had great deep tissue massages and then lingered in the spa's warm pools. Rec'd our requested room near the main pool with unobstructed views to the eastern hills. Late-afternoon lap swimming in the deserted 130ft pool, probably because it was a damp and cloudy day. Didn't have time to play bocce ball or use the bikes. Back to the bar at Solbar for oysters and cocktails, followed by a delicious dinner (also at the bar). Great night's sleep in a comfy bed with turndown service (bedside lemon water and chocolates), morning room-made coffee with fresh cream in provided to-go cups, paperless checkout, a quick stop at Bouchon in Yountville for yummy pastries, and then a traffic-free ride back in SF dropping my daughter off at work before noon. It's the perfect 24hr getaway.",
4,When the fog rolls in to our home in Marin,"We roll over to sunny Calistoga and enjoy a few days at Solage. One of the best places in 'Wine country'. Every point of the great great Inn, is only toped by the next. From the rooms to the welcome pool and spa. we always book the one-bedroom Silverado Suite
Perfect for a romantic getaway, a separate living area, fireplace, steam shower and a private outdoor patio with a hot tub.",
5,World class service,"It is difficult to adequately describe the high level of service at Solage. The staff, from waiters to housekeepers to front desk to bell service have been trained by someone extraordinary. Exceptional courtesy and professionalism reign...truly amazing. The chef is also extraordinary, creative but not formal. The rooms are perfect for the semi
rustic contemporary feel at this property and attractively priced for the wine country. Close in pastoral setting, very convenient. Easy to recommend with no worries.",
5,Great getaway with cocktails,One of my most favorite places to grab lunch with visting friends. The accommodations are wonderful and close to town. The pool is so inviting and you won't want to leave. They also provide bikes to ride into town. You will love the town of Calustoga!,
5,Peaceful bliss. Great property and excellent location,"Room is a nice mix of Contemporary California and Luxury.

Linens and mattress are top quality. The individual ""bungalows"" are a nice treat in terms of privacy and serenity. Highly recommended for a couples getaway.

Staff is focused on attention to detail. The front desk, housekeeping and spa all 110% effort. Massage was first rate. The staff at the Spa seemed a little stressed, but ultimately did not ruin the experience.",
5,Intimate perfection of hotel and spa in Napa Valley. Outstanding!,"In Napa Valley, a simple and elegant hotel with exceptional spa facility! Architecture is California "" country""...rooms are in single or double one story farm/ cottage w tin roof. Very large rooms with sliding glass to private patio, paths through gardens to connect to main hotel features like spa, Olympic sized pool, smaller pool just for children and spa pool. By legs are parked by every door to rooms. Restaurant, SolBar, is one of the top in Napa Valley. Breakfast from menu included in price of rooms. Spa rooms and reception all pure, clean white. Sun shines everywhere. Near all the major vineyards and towns for shopping , restaurants. Perfect service from staff. A lovely retreat for my three adult daughters and me on my birthday.",
1,Inexcusable treatment,"I alerted Solage management to my life threatening latex allergy--prior to a facial. I was still exposed--to a massive amount of latex, endured incredible pain, my skin looked & felt like it had been covered in acid. Acute symptoms lasted 2 weeks, I endured emergency hospitalization and ended up with permanent damage to my blood vessels. Cosmetic damage is extensive, ""repairing"" the damage is very expensive & even more painful.

I've been in contact with Solage management & they have not offered anything--not even an apology.",
5,Our go to place for a quick day trip,"We haven't stayed at Solage Calistoga, but this is our go to place for spa treatments and a day trip from San Francisco. We've been trying to book a room, but this needs to be planned ahead of time, as last minute availability is non existent!

Overall, I loved the spa treatments, and the spa itself. The facility is really relaxing. Take a walk around and enjoy the surroundings. I can't wait to come back!",
2,"So close to being perfect... But, it just wasn't.","We went up to Solage Calistoga for a night from the Bay Area to celebrate my wife's birthday and a babymoon. We started out at the pool, which was beautiful and seemed like it'd be a perfect day in the sun. We had a cabana and after being sat and given menus, we waited for 30 minutes before I decided to walk to the other side of the pool to order drinks & food for ourselves (really, I'm not exaggerating - they never came back to ask if we needed anything). Not a big deal, but you'd expect more on a non-busy day at the pool w/ multiple attendants. So I walk up and order; Included in that order was an Iced Tea for my wife, which was never delivered until I went back up to the bar to ask for it (third person I had asked, btw), and this was after we finished our meal (which was ordered at the same time & delivered 15 mins later). I had to walk over to the bar to order my drinks and more food at least 3 more times during the day, so service was an issue... to say the least.

After a day at the pool, we shrugged off the pool experience as just bad luck because the property & room were so great. We went to our dinner at SolBar, which was fantastic. The service was amazing & the tasting menu I ordered was really one of the best meals I've had in Napa.

We woke up the next morning and found out we had no hot water. This was a pretty big let down when we're trying to get ready for Easter Brunch (at SolBar, again) and can't get ready. I'm still not sure if there was an issue with our room, or if the resort simply runs out of hot water from time to time, nobody followed up on the issue. Either way, it was a let down at a resort of this caliber, and no solutions were offered after mentioning it to the front desk.

Solage sent me a link to complete a survey after checking out & I took a long time filling out the highlights & issues we had during our 24 hours at the resort the same evening. I really made an effort to make sure I gave reasonable and constructive feedback. What really surprised me is that I never heard anything back from anyone. I wasn't looking for anything more than someone to say ""hey, when you spend over $1k for one night at our hotel and didn't get hot water in the morning, that sucks and is not up to our standard. We're sorry about that"". I did get another request for a different survey a few days later, but it just left me with a bad taste in my mouth that maybe the bad luck I thought we had with service at the pool was more the standard of the property - and possibly, the great service we had from valet & our server for dinner was the anomaly.

Either way, this place is really, really close to being a perfect place. But when you have so many amazing properties in the area, you shouldn't have service issues (or maintenance) like we had. Sure, it's very possible that we just had bad luck - water heaters go out, I understand that. However, to be allowed to check-out after mentioning no hot water hours before without a simple ""we're sorry about that, is there anything we can do to make you or your 9 month pregnant wife more comfortable? a shower in the spa?"", it just made it seem like they didn't care. When they send multiple requests for surveys and you take the time to respond & they still don't respond, it sort of proved that they didn't care.",
5,Honeymoon!,"My husband and I came here for our honeymoon and it was absolutely wonderful! Exactly what I imagined my honeymoon hotel would be! Amazing pool, awesome car share program, delicious food, and great service!",
1,Huge DISAPPOINTMENT,"My much anticipated visit to Solage was a HUGE disappointment. My daughter and I booked this to celebrate my milestone birthday. Staff is friendly, but service was nothing, but horrendous.
1) did not receive tour of grounds upon check in
2) we scheduled a mudslide and realized we were in WRONG relaxation room when another 2 ladies were getting a tour and we asked if we were in correct area- no - you need to be over there. Our mudslide was not shortened, but impression of service already questionable
3) my daughter's massage was great. Therapist opened the door for better temperature. Her robe was warm & dry. Mine NOT... Fan did not work, towels were not hot and therapist gave me my wet robe ( from mudslide ) to put back on... Really, he couldn't grab a dry warm one?
4) dinner was excellent. First course served right away. Entree about an hour later. They apologized ...
5) morning- daughter waited 45 min for ice
6)after waiting for someone to check me out and note I would return robe upon leaving, I told attendant how awful our service had been and we were NOT IMPRESSED. We went to mineral pool to relax and have lunch
7) just when I thought service couldn't be any worse, we waited 45 min for lunch to be served only to receive half of the order (taco) with sauce. It was ordered WITHOUT sauce and my daughter never received her shrimp cup. Never received an apology for this
8) upon returning robe to registration, I told them about lunch. Attendant said manager was trying to get a hold of me. Really ? How? It is now 3 hours later and no phone call or email. He did come out and apologized for our very horrible experiences with lack of service
9) special occasion ? Nothing was followed up for my birthday
10) DON'T go to Solage. Much better and more positive experiences at so many more spas",
5,"As peaceful,soothing and active as you want it to be","Nicely appointed individual cottages, with sufficient distance and arranged to feel very independent, yet close enough not to feel too lonely. Great beds, spacious rooms, and great food (One Star Michelin), and nice spa with a really soothing hot, mineral water pool. 2 bicycles included with each room. Well appointed Gym, with some training included. The town and vineyards, close by and safe to ride the bikes.",
4,"Serenity, a piece of heaven","Had lunch here with a group of friends in between wine tasting. What a lovely and peaceful place to chill. The fare was delicious in true California style, service attentive and overall experience delightful. I'd love an opportunity to spend a few days relaxing on the grounds of this hideaway.",
4,Last visit a bit off,"Great hotel and spa. Really enjoyed our stay here. The spa is very relaxing. The masseurs and the staff are very friendly. We have been here multiple times but our last visit was a bit off. There were two older couples near the pool that very putting back a few too many. They started berating the poor waiter/attendant. Just very rude and trashy. I was surprised the waiter and the management put up with that kind of attitude and classless guests, especially at a place that's trying to cultivate a high end, zen type setting.",
5,"Solace softened, satiated and soothed me.","Solage. OMG, what an amazing place. I love Calistoga and have stayed in most of the hotels/resorts and had sucked up most of what it has to offer.
The service is top notch on the top shelf.
The bar is amazing. The pools are amazing. The massage is probably the best I have ever had. Yes, it was amazing!
We stayed in one of the cabins and couldn't think of one thing to complain about.
And we tried, oh we tried, but we couldn't stop being amazed.
Drop some cash, relax and soak up Solage.
I wish I were there right now.
It is amazing.",
4,Napa Beyond the Glass,Very comfortable resort & restaurant. Inside - outside dining. When eating inside most of the external wall opens getting a feeling of being outside. Green Asparagus Soup is wonderful as is the Seared Yellowfin Tuna. Also try the Wolfe Ranch Quail.,
5,Absolutely unparralled luxury experience without a hint of pretension.,"This is a heart warming and stunning spot, charming and familiar with a slightly residential feel... the rooms feel like small homes, and are glorious for relaxing, romance, or as a break between the endless swimming, activities, or world class spa experiences they have to offer. I highly recommend the mudslide.... it's a fun and interactive experience to do with your partner, and it takes you into some really unexpected places, like the vibrating sound chair at the end (which is likely the most relaxed I have ever been). It's a perfect spot to explore the entire region, whether Napa, Sonoma, or further afield.... but you're not going to want to go anywhere, and I sort of suggest you let the wine come to you. Solbar is obviously world class, and the room service at Solage is executed shockingly well... really friendly service, but perfectly delivered food. Their breakfast is far too much fun while lingering on the beautiful patio chairs outside your room, staring at the gorgeous landscape and grounds. There's wonderful privacy, and it's a very modest and intimate experience, unlike some luxury resorts that have people gawking at each other. The spa pool is also cell phone free zone, and people are generally quiet and respectful.... it seems they are doing a good job making sure the bachelorette parties end up at the main pool. This is definitely a home away from home for us, and although there are some luxurious, world class resorts nearby that we also love, we have a feeling we won't return to those, again and again, like we will to Solage. =) Thanks all!! We love you!",
5,Unsurpassed,"Just returned from a glorious long weekend at Solage, and our cross country trip and 2-hour drive from SFO was well worth the effort. The grounds are lovely and thoughtfully landscaped. Our room was spotless, relaxing and so well appointed that we didn't mind whiling away a rainy afternoon inside. Once outdoors, we adored the well situated and pristine Olympic-length pool for peaceful exercise, and the spa for soothing treatment. And the service! We were literally pondering a need for additional creamer for the next day's coffee when we heard a gentle knock on the door. Outside, a staffer stood with creamer. The staff was friendly, professional and focused on our needs. I yearn to return!",
5,Perfect Wine Country retreat,"I spent a weekend at Solage resort during a wet and cold January visit to the San Francisco Bay Area. It was just what I expected a first class spa and resort in wine country to be! After moving to Hawaii last year, I was (chuckle) missing the cold California winter weather. Even though the weather was rainy and cold, I got to experience the beautiful nature all around the resort and the warm healing waters of the spa. The classes offered for meditation and yoga were an added relaxation treat. The staff was phenomenally friendly and helpful. Really got to experience the true wine country through Solage. I would return in a heartbeat!",
5,Annual girls trip,"I love Solage! This hotel has it all! The spa is top notch with wonderful treatments. I recommend having their signature mudslide treatment with a friend/partner. They have a wonderful spa boutique with workout clothes and bathing suits. We love lounging at the pool and having some good drinks. They also have a great gym with a lot of classes to take. You can't go wrong with Solbar- delicious food. The cottages are so cute and comfortable. Love that they all have a patio and bikes to cruise around on. Your not far from restaurants, wineries and shops but still away from it all for some peace and quiet. Love it here.",
5,Wine Tasting!,"This hotel is amazing and the service is over the top! We checked in and our rooms and where not ready so we sat outside for lunch and the 4 of us had the best lunch. I had the fried chicken sandwich so good! So they brought our keys to our room and we got a king fire place room and it was so beautiful inside and the bed was so comfortable . A great view out our patio doors and later went to dinner in the hotel restaurant and another great meal, and I had pork chop it was so perfectly cook and great service again.... We will be back for sure!",
4,A great dog friendly retreat in Napa,"This last (Valentine's day) weekend we took a short 2-day break at Solage in Calistoga.

Not being able to obtain a sitter for our 2 senior dogs we took them with us, we all had a great time!

The resort is dog friendly, providing beds, treats and bowls for the pups ...

We choose the Silverado Suite (which is the top room category) as it has a completely
fenced in yard, which is great for allowing your dogs to safely and securely go outside
when they want to.

You can also bring them with you to the Solbar restaurant (outside seating only) if you
want to dine with your pups ...

The resort is very relaxing and is located a short walk (10-15mins) from downtown
Calistoga if you want to walk into town with your pooches...

dont forget to bring dogfood and poopbags as there are none available locally with
Fideaux in St Helena probably being the closest dog store to the resort.

Another tip, get off of Rt 29 asap (Trancas St in Napa or Oak Knoll Ave) and get onto Silverado Trail ... its much nicer and less traffic too!",
5,Luxury in the heart of Calistoga,"Solage has it all, it's an ultra luxurious, modern and chic hotel surrounded by the beauty of Calistoga. It's so romantic! The fireplaces throughout the property, the twinkling lights, the beautiful palm tress, luxurious room with breathtaking views all make this place truly exceptional. I love the privacy aspect of it, the rooms are more like little bungalows all a few feet apart from one another. What truly made our experience unforgettable however was our amazing sommelier MORITZ. After dinner at the Michelin starred SolBar, we wanted to cap off the day with a nice bottle of wine by the fireplace outside. We ordered a bottle of wine suggested by Moritz, but he didn't just bring the wine, he created the most romantic evening for us. He brought us blankets, turned up the flames on the fireplace and even took pictures for us. We sat fireside under the stars with our blankets sipping on a delicious wine. What a memorable evening. We can't wait to go back to Solage for the luxurious romantic experience again!",
4,very relaxing,"Very nice day at Solage, thank you Jasmine! We wanted to enjoy the day at solage, but we were not certain what to choose, as there is so much to choose from. Jasmine helped us to plan an amazing day! We came early to enjoy the fabulous 90+ degree mineral pool, than off to a couples massage. BEST MASSAGE I EVER HAD. LAURIE IS AMAZING! After our massage we enjoyed the couples mudslide treatment...so nice and relaxing...our spa person, Mary was the sweetest, nicest gal ever. We felt very comfortable and not rushed at all. The heated flooring is as very nice plus! We enjoyed unseasonable beautiful weather, but even if it was cold, I think our experience would have been just as nice. The reason I give Solage a rating of four out of five, is due to the noise level, we did here motorcycles driving by now and again. Also, the only fruit was a bowl of apples in the locker room. Having other fruit bowls scattered around the spa would have been nice to have. I have been to other spas where they offer, cookies, nuts, bananas etc...OUTSTANDING SERVICE & SERVICES. We can't wait to go back!",
4,Amazing Pool & Spa,"Really enjoyed our visit here to relax for the most part. The pools are not crowed during the week. All the staff were really nice. My husband enjoyed taking the Mercedes sports car out for spin (free for four hours). Food is a little rich for a spa.

There are construction noises coming from across the street where the Four Seasons is building a huge new resort with several swimming pools over the next year or two. Construction started at 7am with beeping noises and went until 7pm the night we were there. They need to put in more loud waterfalls or something to drown out the sounds until the new hotel is completed.

A perfect place to relax when things are quiet.",
5,Another visit and Solage still shines,"Made a last minute reservation through the hotel for a low season Thursday night stay. The rooms that I previously reviewed near the main pool weren't available; however, we were able to stay in Calistoga King #41 (previously called a Vega King), a row behind those that I especially like (46, 47, 48, 49). #41 is still quite private and quiet, if slightly farther from the main pool. The cottage itself was great as usual, and it was very relaxing to spend time in the spa are and warm pools the evening of our arrival. As we were in our spa robes and didn't want to go into Solbar--although we probably could have--we sat outside near the fire and had a glass of wine. The bar/restaurant manager brought us wool blankets; a nice touch given that it looked like it would rain and was on the cool side. Some complimentary snacks came with the wine.

The beds remain very comfortable, and the heat/AC and ceiling fan are very easy to operate. I did not reserve a room with a fireplace, as our stay was going to be too short to enjoy that, and I knew that we would instead use the spa facilities and enjoy the various fireplaces on the property. Freshly ground coffee, both caf and decaf, as well as a carafe of half & half in the fridge made for a pleasant morning gazing out at the hillside.

As a swimmer, the main pool is unbeatable and unusual for a hotel/resort. Not quite Olympic length (130 feet) and a workout worthy temperature of 80-81 (I carry a pool thermometer) on a cool and rainy day. Deep enough to do flip-turns, and lane lines on the bottom. Plenty of fluffy towels poolside. There is separate jacuzzi at one end.

We had a pre-checkout brunch at Solbar, which had been reconfigured since my last visit. Great food and service. A serene ambiance, but not stuffy.

Back in SF a hour and half later, feeling like we had been on a vacation; it had been less than 24 hours. Perfect.

I still highly recommend Solage and Solbar. Everyone was very welcoming and accommodating, and it's a great getaway from San Francisco, even just for one night.",
5,2nd Trip Just as Great as the First,"We just got back from our second trip to Solage and are already planning to go back. There's just something about how peaceful the resort is and we loved that the pool/mineral pool/hot tubs are open year round. This trip we utilized the gym and mind body studio, both of which were excellent. Jensen taught a wonderful and refreshing yoga class. Customer service was again excellent.",
5,I love the Solage,"I love the Solage Calistoga. The property is beautiful, I love the ""rooms"" (many are individual bungalows), the spa is wonderful and the restaurant creates delicious dishes. Whenever we stay we rarely leave the property. We have spent the last two New Years' here and it's been a wonderful way to usher in the new year.",
5,Amazing Stay,"We found this hotel through Jetsetter and had an incredible and relaxing stay last spring. We feel it would be worthwhile to pay full price and go back! We still look at each other sometimes on a cold and/or tiring day and say, ""Remember Solage?""

Every room at Solage is its own little private hut. Ours was set up like a studio with a huge king bed, beautiful rain/spa shower, and a private patio. We enjoyed sitting out on our patio and having morning coffee or tea.

We booked the mudslide spa treatment and highly recommend it! You choose an essential oil and have a bucket of ""mud"" made to your liking, and then you apply it to yourself in a warm room. You leave with your skin feeling amazing and so relaxed. We also enjoyed the thermal pool after our treatments.

The customer service was amazing, and the staff remembers you and is so friendly. We loved the food as well. I still remember eating gigantic, fresh cherries for breakfast + getting a massive veggie quinoa skillet. There is also drink and snack service by the main pool.

Downsides are Calistoga is a bit farther north from the ""main"" wine country, if that's what you're seeking. We mostly visited smaller wineries and also drove up to Healdsburg/Sonoma for the day. I also think the downtown Calistoga is a bit small and has a more limited restaurant selection. If you stay here, you are doing it more for the property and amenities and need to be willing to travel for some of your tastings, depending where you want to go.",
5,Luxury and peace,"This is the place to stay in Calistoga. If you want to retreat for a while there's nothing like this place as it's surrounded by beautiful fields, a nearby hill that gives you a stunning view of the Valley, a staff committed to provide the best possible service ever. Food is memorable, the restaurant bar is beautiful and cozy. It's really great, you'll enjoy it without a doubt.",
5,First at the hotel,"I've been here several times just for the spa for the day. They have excellent massage therapists here and the spa is gorgeous. I love the hot pools too. This time we stayed for NY's eve weekend and the rooms are perfect - not too over the top, quiet, luxurious in their simplicity, great beds, showers, fast free password free wi-fi and private. Had brunch at Solbar and it was delicious.",
5,Wine Country's Finest,"Just returned from our 5th year at Solage for Xmas...and it only gets better.
The restaurant has been refiured. More bar space and added private dining areas. The Spa has been remodelled and it even more elegant than ever...not to mention the wonderful varieties of pools ( from 96 degrees to 106 degrees) with co-ed pool and clothing optional pools for men and for women. Massage price has gone up but is for a longer time.
The staff at this place is so helpful and friendly. Food at Sol Bar (their restaurant) deserves that Michelin star too.
Bike to town (everyone gets a bike) or walk to town (approx 1 mile) which is what we did to watch the Warriors game downtown at a big screen. The pet-friendliness is wonderful too (they get theoir own bed, feeding bowls and treats).
This place is spectacular.",
4,Nice retreat for a couple,"My wife and I stayed here one night before a wedding in Napa. The resort is very nice and the staff is friendly. You get around by riding bikes, so you better be physically able to ride a bike. The pool is not very crowded during the morning. The gym is nice.",
5,Romantic getaway,Amazing place. Relaxing and beautiful. Great service. Rooms are sophisticated with beautiful attention to details. Comfortable beds. Nice location. Visited nearby Castello di Amorosa winery which was also spectacular .,
5,Wine and bath heaven,"Perfectly nestled in the heart of wine country this spa resort is complete with thermal baths and complimentary bikes to enhance your stay and play experience.
It is one at the top of my list to return to very soon. Enjoying sipping on wine and watching the spectacular sun set over the mountain top all the while oxygenating.",
5,"Top notch spa, and bungalows in wine country","We stayed here for a night to get away from the city. Each room is detached, with luxurious bed linens, soaps, and furnishings. Both the main pool and spa pool are beautiful, and the entire grounds perfectly manicured. All of the staff seemed genuinely friendly and concerned that we were enjoying ourselves. We did mud baths, which included a scrub treatment, and nap in a zero gravity chair. The spa facilities are gorgeous, and a treatment is a must.

Tip: Ask for a room close to the amenities, we were about a 5 minute walk away. Also, I highly recommend the $50 option for breakfast if it's available - you can order as many items as you want until 11 am (a good, or a bad thing!).

We had dinner at the restaurant, which was good but didn't totally blow my mind. My entree was rather salty. However, to be on the premises and be able to walk home after dinner is great.",
5,"Location, Cuisine and Comfort","Solage Calistoga is one of my favorite hotels in the CA wine country. Chic, comfortable, very friendly, delicious cuisine, luxurious spa and best pool for anyone who likes to swim for exercise. I can't say enough positive things about this property",
5,Best spa in Wine Country!,Incredible spa vacation in beautiful California Wine Country! The staff and accommodations were way above all of our expectations! Everything about the Solage is high end. Travelled all over California Wine Country and the Solage in Calistoga blows them all away!,
4,Spa afternoon,"My friend gave me a spa pass and I truly enjoyed myself here. First they couldn't find my pass, so I went to wait at Solbar. Unfortunately their system for people who aren't staying in the hotel is poor. Once I ordered, I had to get out of pool twice asked for credit card to pay for my food/beverage. Why they can't just keep your card on file at the front desk? Also the employee couldn't spell my name and it took 20 minutes to get a coffee. Slightly out of sync place. Fancy, but service is just a-ok.",
4,Enjoyable...,"My wife and I stayed at Solage in February 2015. We had a great experience. The Mercedes program and restaurant (Solbar) are what sets this resort apart from the rest, and I must say the level of service was exceptional.

Pro's: In my opinion, great service really can make a stay much more enjoyable, and the staff at Solage did a great job. We did not come across one employee that was not attentive and polite.The restaurant is awesome, both for dinner and breakfast. We had breakfast included in our package and they really do a nice job. French pressed coffee, great menu options and of course, their famous doughnuts. You will not leave hungry as the portions are hearty. It is a Michelin rated restaurant and it certainly lived up to the reputation. At dinner I ordered the braised short rib with polenta and it was phenomenal. Our server was outstanding, unfortunately, I cannot remember his name (we put in a good word with his manager) but he was attentive, funny and made a great wine selection for us. There are numerous hiking trails in the area that made for a good way to get moving outdoors, if hiking is not your thing the pool is large enough to get a good swim in and has a large hot tub. Bocce ball was a nice touch as well.

Now the cars: For our entire stay we had access to a $140K Mercedes SL. There is nothing like driving through Napa with the top down in a car like this. We had a blast. At night we took the SUV out to dinner in Calistoga. To me this was the best ammenity Solage offered. The bikes a great, dont get me wrong, but the cars just take the cake. Being that it was the slow season, they were not too strict about us returning the cars on time and we used the SL day and night for 4 days straight. One day they let us park it by our room because we were going to Napa for dinner that night. Awesome.

Cons: The rooms were basic. Very comfortable and clean but for the price point these rooms are offered at, I expected a little more. If you are looking for luxury, you will not find it in the rooms, rather you will get a neat and clean cottage feel. Not a big deal, as the vibe here really isnt supposed to be luxurious, its more of a contemporary laid back feel. The spa left alot to be desired, we were rushed through each phase of our spa treaments and it is pretty much impossible to enjoy yourself when you know the staff wants to hurry you through. If I could have done it over again I would have cancelled my appointment, as it was more stressful than relaxing.

Overall it was a great experience, due to the access to the cars, the staff and the restaurant. If we did not have the access to their fleet I would have ranked Solage with one less star. The Mercedes program really is a fantastic service that cant be beat. I am not sure if I would stay again simply because for the price point I think you can find a little more bang for your buck, however I am pleased that we stayed at Solage.",
5,The perfect getaway,"Solage Calistoga was the perfect girlfriends getaway. Relaxed luxury in a most beautiful setting. We had our own cottage complete with bicycles and fireplace. Although perfect for romance, it was also an ideal setting for couples, girlfriends getaways and family retreats. The resort's Michelin Star restaurant did not disappoint. I had the absolute best chicken dish of my life. Truly -- the best! But all of the food was fresh and delicious. The spa is a must -- ask for massage therapist John M.! I didn't get to experience the mud wrap, but other guests raved about it.
We were impressed to see the hotel's General Manager often checking up on guests with a genuine smile and gracious hospitality. We want to go back next year!",
5,Didn't Want to Leave,"This is by far my most favorite place I've stayed in California. Living in the bay area, I visit the wine country often. Solage does it just right. The room was perfect; quiet, clean, full of amenities, great shower, comfortable bed, private. The restaurant was great - everything from the service to the food was top notch. We enjoyed massages at the spa and then floated around in the heated mineral pool afterwards after a day of wine tasting. I mean, it just does't get better than that. The staff here goes out of their way to anticipate and meet your every need. We can't wait to return.",
5,A memorable anniversary,"Recently stayed at the Solage Calistoga for our anniversary. The property was beautiful, the room was incredible and we loved having the fireplace by the bed.
We enjoyed hanging out by the pool and had the most incredible, memorable meal ever at Solbar. The food & wine we enjoyed here are so far unmatched in our book. Absolutely amazing. Hands down the top of our list.
Looking forward to returning as soon as possible.",
5,Another superb experience at Solage!,"Solage offers the best wine country resort experience...from it's striking contemporary style that blends into its environment, cottage-like rooms, personalized service, beautiful pools, large fitness center and class schedule, top-rated restaurant and relaxed atmosphere, Solage has it all...if you haven't stayed here before and are reading this to plan a trip, I am certain that you will love it!",
5,True getaway in Napa valley,"Being located in Calistoga makes your experience of Napa Valley much different than if you stay in the town of Napa or even Yountville. It is quiet and getting around will require a car to get to the wineries in Napa. When you are at the resort, enjoy the property. Two bikes come with each bungalow for tooling around the little town, and wineries in the area. Lots of hiking in the area, and the hotel seems set up for a more active crowd than what Napa typically attracts. Spa with mineral baths is worth a visit! SolBar restaurant on property is a Michelin 1 star, food/service were both terrific!",
5,Amazing getaway experience,"The Solage is one of the few places in the wine country that offers a complete luxury getaway experience. Fantastic hotel in a beautiful setting, world-class spa and mineral springs, attentive and thoughtful service and a Michelin star restaurant on its premises to scratch any culinary itch you may have. There really isn't a need (or desire) to step off the property after you check in. My wife and I did squeeze in some wine tastings and the concierge Jason was very helpful with recommendations and coordinating reservations. The Solage Spa, mineral pools and workout facilities were fantastic and a great way to work off some of the excess food and drinks from the previous night.

Although this is a review of the Solage resort, one of the highlights of our stay was an experience at dinner at their Solbar restaurant. We ordered a foie gras appetizer as one of several shared starters that somehow was missed and our entrees were delivered instead by mistake. Our waiter was very apologetic and while we were a little disappointed, we were enjoying all of the other food and the wine pairings too much. After dinner, desserts were served and the chef surprised us by creating a complimentary special dessert using seared foie gras -- sounds crazy but it was amazing and one of the most memorable and creative dishes we've had in a long time. Definitely worthy of their Michelin star.",
5,GREAT EXPERIENCE AT THE SOLAGE,"We vacationed at the Solage for 5 nights. We were with a group of 100+. This place is top notch in every respect. Room was big & modern with large walk-in shower with a shower head & a hand-held shower. Handicap equipped with a pull-down seat if needed. Big tub. Each room has its own patio. Enjoyed lounging by the big pool one afternoon & going in the mineral pool. Also the hot tub. We were too busy touring wineries to use the spa amenities, which looked wonderful. Had breakfast one morning. All food was delicious! An extra was having bicycles available, which we used to ride into the quaint little town of Calistoga for breakfast. Definitely would return. Great location to wineries!",
5,Serene and gorgeous property!,I brought a group to Solage for a meeting and the entire experience was incredible. The sales/event team made it one of the easiest meetings I have ever planned. I felt like they designed a meeting for me instead of just asking what I wanted. I have been planning meetings for over 8 years and this was a first. The property is immaculate and I love the cottages (the bikes that come with each are a great touch). It does not feel like a hotel but the amenities are impressive. We were also very happy with the food. Overall the cost is higher at Solage but I believe that it was worth every penny. I look forward to hosting another meeting with them in the future.,
1,Don't value guests - not coming back,"I used to love Solage, not anymore. I used to recommend Solage to friends, not anymore.

The whole reason you pay for overpriced spa services at a nice hotel is so that you can relax both with the spa services and facilities. If I wanted a better massage at 50% of the price, I could easily do that anywhere.

I'm a few hours drive to Solage, so I've been there before and never had a problem after paying for expensive spa services to also lounge for a few hours by the pool. I've also never had a problem doing this at any other high-end resort, and we paid $400 in massages to do exactly that. It costs them nothing to allow you to sit by the pools (this isn't a scarce resource) and if you stay longer, you buy more things -- it's a win-win on both sides.

But now, they want to charge each person a $50 day-resort fee IN ADDITION to the $400 we paid for massages, so let's see, $500 to basically sit by the pool.

They said this was stated on a email confirmation which I never received. Moreover, when I told them we would not be paying their resort fee and would be leaving instead, it still took them two tries to fix it -- they just ""discounted it"" first and hoped I wouldn't notice. The whole exchange took almost an hour of our time and made me wish we had never come to Solage in the first place.

Since I've been there a few times for spa services, here are my reviews:

Their ""signature mud slide"" involves a small pail of mud that you paint on yourself and then a weird vibrating chair. There's really no service involved (the people there don't do the treatment) and it isn't useful for anything except having a laugh.

The massage was good, but not great -- I still had knots in my back. For $200, you can get a lot more somewhere else. If you can't use the facilities for 1-2 hours, what's the difference between coming here and going to a less glitzy massage parlor elsewhere?

My recommendation, go somewhere else. If they don't want their guests to have a good time and return, I'd suggest to spend your money with someone who will.",
5,Great experience!,"Share a cup of rose champagne with your wife sorrounded by beatiful gardens at the magical Napa... Priceles!
We visited Calistoga on our way to Lax.
Food was good, more like tacos and mexican food but the place was
Great!",
4,One of the most relaxing hotels to come as a couple,"Exemplary service and quality of food and beverage...
Location is great despite being on the valley floor.
We have eaten three meals a day here and have been happy throughout.
We will be back.
Ps the spa is fantastic with great service and smiles all round",
5,Super place and spa!,"I really loved Solage and still stalk about it almost a year on! We stated there on a last minute trip to Ca got Christmas and we were really impressed.

Location is great - lots of wonderful vineyards locally to visit by bike (especially lava next door) is a quick roll home at the end of the tasting day!

Our room was great, the gym well equipped and the pools lovely. The hot springs were amazing especially late at night or early in the morning when there was a chill in the air.

The breakfast was a real treat too and set on the beautiful pool side patio.",
5,"Lovely, peaceful, extraordinary","I struggled to title my review of Solage because it is so many great things combined into one package. The property: perfectly nestled at the quiet northeast end of Calistoga and landscaped with beautiful, eco-friendly, and aromatic foliage. The ""rooms:"" dotted around the grounds like your own private oasis -- detached studios/suites that are roomy and very well designed (studios have a separate bathroom and beautiful walk-in shower located in the rear of the studio behind a floating wall). Each studio/suite also has its own private patio, as well as two ""cruiser"" bikes that are fun to ride into town or to one of the many wineries that are close by. The food: Michelin Star restaurant. And, yes, it is just that good. There is also a perfect bar where you can get a drink and an appie while watching the game on one of the two flat screen TVs. The service: I've stayed at a lot of nice places, but rarely do you get the feeling that the staff really does care about whether you are enjoying yourself. The staff at the Solage exudes that vibe without being showy or too attendant. The spa/pool/gym: everything you need or want. The gym (my deal more than the spa) is well equipped. And, after a long run in the hills, the various pools in the spa were awesome.

Solage is definitely a place where you could stay for a few days without ever leaving the property, but is also a great place to come back to after a fun day trip. I hope to be back there soon!",
5,Home away from home,"This place is amazing. For you Bay Area locals who think, ""I don't know, it seems a little ex."" It's worth it. For you out-of-town honeymooners who say, ""I don't know, it's not in Napa."" Go stay in Napa, so my pool doesn't get overcrowded :)

Seriously though, this place is great. My husband and I have considered joining the club, since we frequent the Solbar, and occasionally treat ourselves to a weekend stay and/or spa day. Solage is THE place to go when you need to get away from the SF fog. Year round, it's a nice place to stay. The spa+baths are excellent, the food is excellent, the service excellent. Rooms cozy. Love it.",
5,Life changing experience...,"I'll have to review again using my full keyboard but it means so much to me (to us, my wife included) that I need to do this now. We adore Solage... we came as part of a work sponsored vacation and have been transformed by the beauty, serenity, luxury, sincere and delicate, attentive and lovely staff, I could go on. And all these accolades despite the fact that many who work here have been devastated by the recent wildfires.

I cannot say enough now, a second review will follow, but simply thank you for giving us a lovely week!",
4,Decent stay but a few hiccups,"I'd recommend this place with a few comments and caveats. First off, they aren't as polished as they should be. Upon arrival, nobody greeted us at valet and it wasn't immediately clear where to go. After wandering a bit, we found reception but had to wait to check in. I had mentioned to them during a previous call that we were on our honeymoon but at no point during our stay was this recognized. The attendants at the pool were either very helpful or totally absent. It was almost weird. The inconsistency of this place is impressive. Also, housekeeping came to our room each day at 8:30am and 5:30pm. As those times are the only times we are almost guaranteed to be there, i found it very odd. By the end of our visit, we just passed on room service and left the privacy sign up 24hrs a day. Now the good stuff. Pool was
Great, rooms were clean, room service was quick, spa was amazing, and sol bar had good food and even better drinks. We would go back if we got a good deal but management should refine what it means to run a $600+ per night resort. Expectations are high and you should meet them. Overall though, give it a shot and see what you think.",
5,Amazing Honeymoon,"My husband and I stayed at Solage for 5 nights after getting married in Napa. The property is extremely private and quiet, which was perfect. The mineral pool at the spa is very relaxing, which the main pool can get a little loud/crowded on the weekends. The rooms are separate huts, which adds to the privacy. We loved being able to open the doors to our patio every morning while relaxing in the complementary spa robes. The shower had the natural pebble flooring, which is a nice touch. Added bonuses are the Michelin rated Solbar, Spa Solage, and the free to rent Benz convertibles. I fear now that we have been spoiled and will have to return to Solage for all future Napa trips.",
5,Decadent,"A first rate hotel. Perfect for couples or girls trip in wine country. Beautiful rooms and amazing amenities. Great location for wine tasting by bike and shopping and eating in nearby Calistoga. Fabulous service from concierge, front desk and in room service. Would definitely return. Solbar restaurant was good but there are other restaurants I would recommend over it for the money/food in the area.
Overall a stunning property, quiet, private and lovely. An oasis!",
5,A special occasion getaway,"I have been to Solage three times in very different weather...rainy and cold and hot/heat wave. Both times were excellent and had completely different vibes, but I loved it and was relaxed and had fun and great food in a beautiful setting. Yes, it is pricey, but for me it's a special occasion kind of place. The spa has been under construction and now what was a really nice spa is just extraordinary. I love SolBar. The food is fantastic - some of the best that I have had anywhere. If you are going to splurge for a getaway with your loved one or friends, then this is as good as it gets.",
5,Wish I had more time,"From the moment we drove up we were greeted with smiles. We didn't even have to get out of the car. They checked us in and escorted us to our rooms. Quick lunch and on to the spa. Incredible body scrub, followed by a wonderful massage.

Excellent service, beautiful room, lovely property.",
5,Excellent Service,"Relaxing atmosphere and excellent service. This is one of the best places I've ever stayed at. They have really great food at the restaurant onsite, beautiful grounds, and a gorgeous spa with awesome amenities. Did I mention the service? Excellent!",
5,Best stay in the wine country,"Amazing place, perfect stop during visiting the wine country - just outside of Calistoga, conveniently located both for Napa and Sonoma, Solage is a small luxury resort, with perfectly furnished villas, few large pools, including very pleasant hot-spring one and some great perks for the guest (if you feel like renting for free 450 hp convertible & al). One of the best places around for a few days stop during wine tastings.",
5,Everything you could ever want in Wine Country!,"My husband and I had the most amazing experience here. We loved our room, the pool, the spa, the location, the restaurant-everything! We ate at Solbar 3 times. The food was creative and wonderful. We spent 6hrs at the spa one day. We never wanted to leave. Book an appointment for the scrub and massage and the mud bath! The hotel also gives you 2 bikes per room and access to a Mercedes. We took the convertible out just for kicks. We are definitely coming back!",
5,Pleasant and Relaxing Experience,"I spent a pleasant family holiday, the services offered by the hotel were excellent including the spa.
We spent most of the time by the pool and the food at the restaurant was exceptional. We had a great time!! Thank you!!",
5,Service!,"Perfect in every way! Accommodation, food and service. Came to celebrate my 20th anniversary and was given a complimentary bottle of wine:)
Sumptuous bedding beautiful bathroom with double sink. Private jacuzzi and patio. Perfect in every sense. If you like feeling pampered this is the spot!",
5,Perfect Experience!,"I can""t say enough about this wonderful resort! I heard a guest say on our first day (their last) that they wanted to stay another week. By my last day, I understood why! The accommodations are fabulous, the food (Michelin rated) is the best around, the spa and inclusive exercise classes are top notch and the poolside experience is the best I have ever encountered anywhere. All of this is due to the fact that the staff seem to genuinely love their jobs, and it translates to a wonderful customer service experience on top of the first class resort and amenities. Everything there was amazing, and I couldn't come up with anything I would change. I spent four nights with my adult daughter and we almost cried when we had to leave. I can't wait to come back! Best decision we made on our entire Napa trip was to stay there!",
4,"Great Stay, but, Look at the Resort Map to Choose your Room","Great Staff and Impeccalbe Service. Food and service at restaurant is fantastic. As others have written the wonderful cottages/rooms are beautifully decorated and spacious and super clean. Pool area is sublime. All the cottages have little patios with sofas - where you can sit outside and relax in the quiet - that is - unless your cottage backs up to the Silverado Trail where what you hear is an endless stream of traffic. One Trip Advisor reviewer posted a picture of the resort map - and this is a helpful tool in picking your room. IF you want to sit outside in quiet, avoid those rooms/cottages closest to Silverado Trail. If you also look at google maps - you get a good idea of the property lay out.
Yes, I would stay there again, I would just be more selective in where my room was located.",
4,Splendid hotel / resort,"Beautiful setting close to the small town of Calistoga.
The rooms are all seperate luxurious apartments, state of the art design with eye for detail. Airco (silent), overhead ventialtor, gas fireplace, nice outside patio, beautiful shower and bath. All good. Bikes for getting around for each apartment.
They have three pools, all beautiful, one for kids, one for adults and one connected to the beautiful spa. Gym with new state of the art equipment. I wasn't impressed with the food we got as a group (business purpose), but when eating individually aftweards quality was good.
Wifi is very fast, both in the room as around the resort.
You can use several complimentary Mercedes cars for free for a fewe hours a day.
Staff is very helpful, was a bit surprised to be charged 15 dollars to be brought to my apartment, shouldn't be necessary for a place as expensive as this.
Overall it is worth the money, a beautiful place in the north part of the Napa valley.",
4,A relaxing resort,"This was our second stop to stay (came from Yountville - Bardessono) and upon first driving up (it was 3 pm) room was still not ready, so was told that would call on cell (never did) but it allowed us to check out the town nearby. After coming back they asked for our credit card while we were still parked outside, no valet, so we weren't going to hand someone our credit card while we were in our car. Said we would follow them in. A man on bicycle then bikes in front of you to show your place. Ask for a closer cottage, rather than one of the far off ones behind the affordable housing complex.

Room was very nice, but wanting to unpack suitcase as this was our last stay, and no luggage holder that was made for a larger suitcase (only the ones for carry on), so was delivered two to hold it up. Not one dresser to unpack some of the tops, yes closet with hangers there, but would have been nice to have dresser just below TV, as that was were there was sufficient space for it. So for the 4 days, had to go in and out of suitcase.

The atmosphere of spa is truly relaxing, all in white-spa feel, waiting room very nice, work out area great. Very nice to see a room with a great view for the free Yoga and Meditation classes. This was a plus as well as the free 2 bikes with each room. (Free but higher priced nightly rate - feel this at least what they should include as well as some more free classes have 6 or 7 options during each day & night) Bikes had comfy seats, but wish there were some more safer bike trails around, but that's an urban planning issue. Cars zip by too quickly on Silverado Trail for my liking.

The mineral pool was very nicely heated, as we stayed more in this one then the larger general area. Nice that they had kids pool beside that one. Also the mini private (no clothing required) pools for those that just like to au naturelle and go back and forth between spa treatments and pool.

I would say this is a place for those who want to do daily spa pampering, still be able to work out, after all the wonderful wine tasting & good food. A rental car in this place is a good suggestion, so you can travel around a little more and explore.

Did have a business conference going on while we stayed and do see this as also a great business trip for a group as well.",
5,A Fabulous Location for Business,"I joined 23 other professionals for a 3 day intensive conference at Solage. The meeting place was wonderful. The accommodations were top tier and the resort has a peaceful vibe. The food that was served for every meal was delicious and everybody truly enjoyed the overall experience. We had tournaments at the bocce ball courts and that was a blast. Each suite comes with bicycles. One of the evenings we took the bikes into town to a bar to hear a band. What a site, a dozen or so 40-60 year-olds riding bikes home from the bar at midnight! I want to come back soon with my husband. The coffee service in the room was very special, with fresh cream available in your fridge.",
4,Best Spa Experience Napa Has to Offer!,"My husband and I have stayed at numerous Napa luxury resorts including Auberge du Soleil, Meadowood, Calistoga Ranch and Carneros Inn, but what sets Solage Calistoga apart from the others is their superb and comprehensive spa and fitness facilities. If you yearn for a vacation to get your body detoxified and straightened out or you just want to lounge by the pool, then this wellness resort is the right one for you.

The rooms are quite spacious, clean, and thoughtfully laid out. Decor is minimal and reminiscent of Scandinavia style. I like their strong rain showers with the rock tiles. Each room is equipped with a pair of bikes to help you get from one part of the property to another, since the property is quite large. Wi-fi was free and fast.

The breakfast was exceptional, and one of the best i have experienced in the whole of Napa. Service was outstanding as well!

The reason why my husband and I gave the resort 4 stars instead of 5 is because my husband and I believe outdoor spaces are a way to create a unique guest experience, and Solage Calistoga lacked that exterior environment (no valley views, vineyards, etc). The pool side dining area however was the only area we recalled with a beautiful backdrop (photo included). Interior environments can also create a certain mood. The rooms as mentioned were quite minimal in design, and I guess I preferred a room that had a bit more color, detail or style to it.


The price, $670 for a standard room is not bad compared to the $1000 plus rooms at Carneros, Auberge and Calistoga. If you don't mind not having a view and prefer pool views to valley views, then this resort is for you!",
5,An excellent choice - PERFECTION,"My wife and I enjoyed Solage for a week while celebrating a special 30th anniversary last week and as a seasoned hotelier, we were looking for a unique and special experience. Solage did not disappoint and is well planned and exceptionally well managed. Exceptional customer service, beautiful grounds and overall very well done. Highly recommended when visiting the Napa Valley. Cheers!!!",
5,Relaxing Getaway,"I have dreamed about going to Solage for the past 5 years and got to finally go. It did not disappoint. The grounds are amazing - cutest little bungalows and although they are close together each one is so private. I don't think I saw any neighbors and was able to work from the patio with only the sounds of nature. The wifi on the property is very strong all over - if you do need to log into work or connect through your phone. I had the best massage of my life here - I got the Solage Sampler package. The massage and scrub were amazing! I was so bummed when it was over. The facilities are spot on - clean, gorgeous, relaxing. The food at SolBar is amazing. I am still craving the fish tacos! Please please please try the fish tacos - they do not disappoint. We took full advantage of the cars and bikes on the property to go to wineries and into town. The only downfall of the whole stay was on the day I arrived - there was a bachelorette party at the pool and they were beyond wasted. They were yelling, running around, falling down, bleeding in the pool etc - for the price point of Solage, I was disappointed that it felt like a pool party in Vegas.",
5,Outstanding Spa Experience,"I was visiting the Spa with two friends from Miami Fl. and we had planned to spend our whole day at the spa which came highly recommended. When we arrived we were informed that our treatments were booked for a later date and that they were no more treatments available for the day. Having come all the way from Miami we were very disappointed. The manager Jasmine came out to the front desk and immediately tried to move things around to accommodate us and fit us in for some treatments. She was kind, professional and turned what would have been a very bad experience for us into an unforgettable one. She went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and have a relaxing and wonderful experience at the spa. The Spa is one of a kind and I HIGHLY recommend the mudslide spa treatment which is unique and one you will more than likely only find in this kind of facility. The massage was one of the best I ever had. Outstanding customer service, incredible facility and the highest quality treatments.",
5,Every trip gets better than the last,"We have been coming here every year since 2009 after it opened and they keep looking for ways to make it better. Bigger locker room, redesigned bar and indoor dining, complimentary usage of Mercedes (if you are up early ). And cannot forget the staff especially Jason. We will be back :)",
5,Fantastic resort!,"We had an amazing stay here. The resort is simply beautiful and the studios are quiet and well appointed and very clean. The only criticism I had is the lack of a double-sink in the bathroom--most luxury hotels have that feature so it was strange not to have that when I assume most people here are couples on vacation, not business travelers. Anyway, the spa and fitness accommodations are exceptional. The free classes are also great and a real benefit to staying. Pools are great, both the spa mineral pool and the regular adult pool. Lots of attendants and while busy, we always found a spot to put our things. Service was wonderful, everyone was friendly and helpful. Solbar is also very good, we had brunch and snacks and loved the food. We would definitely stay here for another weekend getaway.",
4,Annual Wine Trip,"2nd time to stay at Solage. Cottages are quaint but nicely furnished. Solbar has great food, although menu is small. Service is very good. Perhaps the only negative comment about Solage is the price...seems a bit high. However compared to Auberge it's a bargain!",
5,Incredible service!,"The price was a bit high, but the hotel was giggle recommended, so we went for it. No regrets at all! The service was brilliant, very friendly and polite staff. The resort itself is very spacious, you have complimentary bikes offered, which you can take off property, some spa services are included. The range of bath products is amazing in the hotel, they produce cosmetics line themselves. The restaurant awarded a Michelin star was very good for dinner, as expected, but for breakfast I ordered lemon-ricotta panacea with blueberry syrup and they were AMAZING! My husband was truly happy about another service that is provided by the hotel - you can take a car for up to 4 hours. The best part is about what car: we drove Mercedes sls 550! And it is all complimentary.

Amazing experience! I wish we stayed for more than one night.",
5,Service is impeccable. Even checkin comes to you!,"*Disclaimer* I am married to the best husband in the world.

My husband surprised me w a birthday trip to Napa. He only informed me of number of days we'd be gone and what kind of temperatures I needed to pack for. Lo and behold, we take a scenic drive from the airport and pull up to a property I have been salivating over! To top it off, the receptionist came out and guided us to remain in our car while they check us in and get our keys. Ooh la la! Then we are taken to our very own cottage w a private patio, huge shower, 2 bicycles, and on-demand fireplace. I'm sure Solage is a slice of heaven on earth.

From the juice bar smoothies to the meditation and yoga classes to the food onsite to the basil water during turndown service, Solage is impeccable! You're in walking/biking distance to downtown and a host of local wineries. (Be sure to exit out of Solage and hook a right on the bikes to get to Brian Arden Winery. You'll thank me later;))

In a word, we'll be back!

Now I'm off to plan a surprise getaway for the hubs and hope to outdo him. :D",
5,Wow!!,"All I can say about this hotel is WOW! First and foremost, the property is BEAUTIFUL! We were there for my sister's wedding and the venue was perfect. I am in customer service and I can tell that the staff prides themselves on their customer service experience for their guests. From the moment you step onto the property, you are treated to a 10 star experience. I cannot say enough great things about this hotel and its staff!",
5,Five star resort!,"This resort is beautiful and a splurge! The room rates are sky high but it's an absolutely beautiful resort with a wonderful staff and many things to do right on the property. Each bungalow room comes with two bikes to ride any time anywhere during your stay. This was so fun! The grounds are stunning and there is a large main pool in addition to two other ""spa"" pools (one spa pool is clothing optional each for men and women separately, the other in a shared pool). The location is great too - just around the corner from downtown Calistoga. I highly recommend staying here for a relaxing splurge vacation any time!",
5,Amazing romantic birthday trip!,"My husband treated me to a stay at Solage for my birthday and we were so impressed. We've stayed at some incredible resorts around the world and Solage really felt on par in terms of service and accommodations. They've really thought of everything. The cute cruiser bikes next to the front door, amazing spa and amenities, fruit infused water, beautiful yoga space with classes for guests (and a really legit yoga teacher), serious attention to detail in rooms and a bottle of wine upon arrival. I could go on and on but basically it's amazing and worth the price! Food at the restaurant was also really good. Wine tasting the first night we were there was awesome, and the grounds are immaculate. Kind of wished the rooms had better views, since Calistoga is so beautiful, but it was so quiet and nice that I can't complain. Check out my blog post for some extra pics! Can't wait to stay here again! http://freshmeetsfierce.com/a-weekend-in-california-wine-country-and-the-scoop-on-organic-grapes/",
5,4 nights at the Solage Calistoga,"Worth the money.

The entire staff was great. Both concierges (Kathy and Jason) were attentive, knowledgeable and responsive. Kendra, who checked us in, was fast and friendly. Hector was super nice. I knew I was going to enjoy my stay. Everyone made us feel welcome without being intrusive. The staff was a big highlight.

We had a room with a king sized bed. It was beautiful. The ceilings were high, the shower was gorgeous, there were lots of windows, a beautiful gas fireplace and a private patio. Wifi was included. There was a normal coffee pot with freshly ground coffee, which was delicious. When I asked for things, I got them before I could finish the question! I asked for ice in the room and it came within 5 minutes. The TV was huge and it was literally the best picture I have ever seen.

The pool was just beautiful. As soon as you enter the pool area someone helps you settle in with towels, the umbrella placement and a drink. It was a treat.

So, if you want privacy, beauty, lovely surroundings, impeccable service, peace and quiet, book this hotel.

The only criticism I have is the recommendation to hire a driver to see the wineries. It is $95/hour and a min 5 hours. I think it would be better to drive on your own, and do one a day.",
5,5 Star Experience!,"My wife and I have been fortunate to stay at some of the finest resorts in the world...With that said, Solage is with out a doubt one of the nicest places we've ever stayed at!
Four years ago we ran the Napa Valley Marathon and did a couples treatment at the Spa afterwards. We were staying at another resort but promised ourselves that one day we stay there. In celebration of an upcoming anniversary, we just returned from an experience that exceeded our expectations!
Everyone from housekeeping, spa and the renowned restaurant Solbar were professional and friendly. The accommodations were impeccable!
The grounds were beautiful and the location is amazing.
It's nice how each room provides cruiser bikes to stroll the property or ride into town.
Solage, Thank you for a very special experience! We can't wait to return for another special stay.",
5,Location Location,"This time we were three. Me, husband and daughter.(12) I called the day of arrival to check availability at the resort I stayed in 7 years ago. I did not have to jump through hoops to get to a bit of a deal in price which made me feel a bit better as the night before I had to talk with 3 differnt agents for similar property in the valley.
Arrived at 2pm and had requested an early check in but as expected that was a no.
We relaxed at the BEAUTIFUL pools! The water was just perfect. At 430 we checked into our room which was a bungalow with 2 queens. Very nice and a good location. I had asked for an upgrade to a unit that had a tub but they would only grant the request for $100.

We went to the Spa which is 5 star AMAZING! Loved it! The mineral pools and areas are just wonderful.Spa is complimentary to resort guests. My daughter could not use mineral pools but was allowed to shower in the outdoor showers which she thought was so cool!

The complimentary bikes are another great amenity given. We rode to dinner in town which is just a short ride on a safe trail away. This is one of the reasons I love this resort. We did not have to get in out car for 2 days! Calistoga has great restaurants and shops to browse in which are walking distance. Rode home, took a night swim and we all had a great rest. Rode our bikes to breakfast and around town before we had to check out at 1pm. We then went to the pool swam and ate for a few hours before leaving to go home.
I hope to visit Calistoga again and if im lucky, stay at the amazing SOLAGE!",
5,Amazing Experience,"This is simply one of the best experiences I've had. The amenities, location, staff and experience will stay with me for a long time. If you have the opportunity to stay here, do not second guess it for one minute. Take advantage of everything the resort has to offer.",
5,Solage is First Rate,Fabulous experience at the Solage. Renovation of the spa is magnificent. Service is quite good throughout the hotel. several meals there were outstanding as well. Rooms have a unique design and are comfy and warm.,
2,Overpriced and extremely mediocre,"Such a mediocre hotel asking high prices. Stayed two nights this past weekend, Friday and Saturday. One of the key requirements for the hotel was having late night in room dining because we were going to be coming back very late and Napa is obviously an early closing town. The hotel website (edit, see here, dated 6/2015: solagecalistoga.com/wp-c…) and the front desk confirmed there was in room dining available 24 hours - it specifically says so on the fact sheet and in the hotel details! Of course, when we tried to order, not only was nothing available but the attendant didn't even try to help. Instead, the rude person on the phone said - why don't you just wait till tomorrow! False advertising at its finest.

Next morning, 8:30am, rudely awakened by housekeeping banging on the door of the 'studio' (which, by the way, has no privacy - there are people walking by right outside on your 'patio') and the walls are paper-thin. I asked housekeeping to come back later, but could still hear them cleaning/talking in the adjoining room. Of course when I returned at the end of the day, the room hadn't been cleaned. I told the front desk about this at checkout -- the guy just shrugged and said 'well, I think you'll get an email asking for feedback'

This is one of those 'trying to be hip' properties that can't even get the basics right - and the attitude is just insufferable. Auberge, which is a fantastic property, recently sold their stake in this one - perhaps that's where the service and quality went downhill. Many better places to stay in the area - Auberge, Merrywood, or even a charming b+b - at least they promise what they can deliver, unlike this place. Stay far away!!!",
4,"Modern and Beautiful Property, Slightly Overpriced","Pulling up to Solage, you are greeted by beautiful, native California landscape and immediately treated to excellent service. The valet attendant brought us water and checked us in without ever having to leave our car! He then escorted us to our room, carried in our bags (including a case of wine we picked up from a winery on our way from the airport), asked us if we had any questions and politely made himself scarce (which is our preference).

We stayed in a Vega Studio room, which is located near the adult swimming pool. (We got lucky in that our room was not immediately next to the pool, but several villas away to avoid the noise.) The decor is minimalist and modern, which we love, the bed complete with high quality linens and comfortable mattress, and the room also includes a lovely outdoor sitting area that is semi-enclosed with native plantings. So far, so good.

Where we took issue, is that the bathroom (which has an open plan into the bedroom - we love that and don't mind) did not include double sinks nor a bathtub. For a resort of this caliber and when paying $500+ per night we expected those amenities at a minimum. The layout is actually quite good, but where there is a perfect spot for a soaking tub across from the sink, there is instead a bench with cushions which doesn't really serve any functional purpose. Then there is the issue of the sink. There is a large stone counter which is big enough to accommodate two sinks, but only one is present and pushed over to one side. I suppose for those people who have a lot of toiletries, jewelry or makeup, the counter space is necessary. But, we would have sacrificed the counter space so we didn't have to brush our teeth or wash our hands in turns. A small thing, but one that is worth mentioning for a luxe resort such as this.

Aside from that, the grounds are incredibly lovely though not as lush as other resorts in this price point where we've stayed. I actually appreciated that, as we are in a long drought here in CA and the plants at Solage don't require much water to thrive. Also, Solbar (the on site restaurant) is very good and occasionally worth the splurge (resort prices). Venturing out into Calistoga is easy and quick, as Solage provides each room with two free bicycles, and there are plenty of choices for top quality dining there as well.

Definite perks for staying here are the included use of not only the adult pool (which is HUGE and can get a bit sceney on the weekend), but also a very nice gym facility and mineral pools / baths in the spa. No charge for those pools or the use of the steam room, which is nice for those who want to relax away from the pool scene and use some of the facilities without having to pay for a spa treatment.

Initially, we thought the stay was very overpriced for what it was, but after visiting some other properties in the area it is actually pretty reasonable. The area is just very expensive and we'd much rather pay the extra $100 or so to stay at Solage than at another property that's not nearly as nice or updated for that much less.

Overall, we'd love to go back, but will be looking for a deal on Jetsetter or other travel discount site to take advantage of some savings.",
5,Great Visit!,"We stayed last week on the Girls Getaway and had fantastic time!!

The service was great--the pool service was perfect. Loved having access to the bikes and being able to ride into town. Meals and drinks at SOLBar were great.
We shipped our Wine back via the hotel and it was convenient to not have to hassle with it.
The small touches like turn down service were nice.

Only complaint is the shower pressure is terrible. I questioned it--and was told that it was due to the drought.

I would return and recommend to others! Love that it was off the beaten path from ""napa""--- had a laid back vibe--and was surrounded by great wineries!",
5,Excellent service!!!,"I came two separate times to solage while visiting friends in the area and every time the staff was so helpful and friendly! Our server both times was magnificent! Attended to every need w a smile and my friends can be admittedly a lil needy. The sex in the vineyard cocktail was magnificent, the Hefeweizen-one of the best I've ever had & ricotta pancakes at brunch were heavenly! Surely worth every penny!",
5,"Lovely grounds and excellent restaurant, but rooms are sterile","Great service--we were greeted right away by two strong men who drove us right up to our suite with luggage, camera case, etc. They were very helpful and made us feel special. Service is a plus! But after spending $800 on a room, I'd like it to feel sunny and warm. Instead, the room was dark and kind of gloomy. That said, all the features were top notch -- the shower and tile surround, the tub and extra-wide flat screen TV really scored. Also appreciated the organic chocolate on the pillows at night. Your best bet is to make reservations at Solbar for dinner and lie down by the amazingly refreshing pool. We had a salad in our chaise lounges, and there's no shortage of cold drinks of all stripes and colors.",
4,Relaxed Napa Valley Escape,"We spent four nights here in July, our room was very comfortable and well designed. The fairly private covered terrace was a nice feature. Prior to arrival the concierge provided good advice on dining options in the valley and vineyards to visit. The gym was very busy in the morning, we had to wait for the treadmills. There are some exercise classes but more high intensity as opposed to yoga and mat Pilates classes would have been preferable. The location is an excellent base to explore the region and is beautifully sited and landscaped. The only shortfall is the dining, we had three breakfasts and one dinner in the restaurant and were disappointed every time. The food falls very short of the excellent staff and service. In general we loved the style of the resort and the relaxed feeling.",
5,Look for the overnight deals,"Solage is a beautiful property about 2 hours from San Francisco in Calistoga. The rooms are clean and have small patios. Some patios are more private than others. The gym is really nice and they offer various classes. If you want to go for a night, you can save money and experience it by keeping your eyes open for last minute deals. Or you can go for a while and fully relax. There are excellent wineries around the hotel and the Silverado Trail is one of the most beautiful areas up North. The service is top notch and it is one classy and clean hit hotel.",
5,Napa's Most Charming resort,"We just returned from a wonderful week in Napa and we started the holiday with 3 nights at the stunning Solage in Calistoga. We HIGHLY recommend this place. Beautiful surroundings - mountain ranges, easy walk or bike ride to charming town of Calistoga. Gourmet dinner at Solbar. Yummy breakfasts outside. swam daily in the pool.",
5,"Luxurious, tranquil, simplicity at it's best!","Solage Calistoga is my new favorite resort. It was my first stay here and I will definitely be back!!! I LOVED everything about it. I love how you have your own individual cabanas (rooms) which adds to the peaceful ambience and the feeling of getting away from everything. The rooms are contemporary, nicely decorated, very comfortable, and a perfect size. Great bathrooms, beds, sheets, pillows, and chairs to sit on both inside and outside your room. You have your own private patio to enjoy a bottle of wine. The entire place is laid back but designed with a simple elegance, beautiful pathways connecting to the pool, restaurant and spa. The landscape is amazing....very well designed. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are all DIVINE at their Michelin rated restaurant and I loved the interior decoration of the restaurant as well as sitting outside by the fire under the canopy of trees. Spa is amazing, and I practiced yoga (on my own) in their exercise room (between classes) and loved the setting. We spent time by the pool, the spa, and riding bikes around the property. This is the kind of place that you never want to leave during your entire stay. Lastly the service can't be beat! Every single person who works here from the moment you check in, to the bell boy, to the maids, to the hostess and waiters in the restaurant, were not only professional but very friendly and definitely were a big contributing part to the perfection of our experience here. My husband and I were wanting to unwind and just spend time together and we couldn't have picked a better setting. Definitely my favorite place to stay in the entire Napa Valley area!",
5,Luxurious Wine Country Retreat,"We just returned from our third stay at Solage Calistoga and had another outstanding time. The facilities are great and the relaxed atmosphere really helped us unwind and truly enjoy.

The large rooms are furnished comfortably with a well designed modern bathroom/dressing room area, and a private patio. Small touches in the room made our stay even better. There’s a coffee maker, two canisters of ground coffee (regular and decaf), an iPad you can use to order food and other services, and wine glasses. The room’s large sliding doors open up to a private patio with comfortable furniture. It’s a perfect spot to relax in the morning and have a leisurely breakfast. The King bed is so comfortable it will instantly put you to sleep. Most importantly the room was spotless and the housekeeping is one of the best I’ve ever encountered. Everyday my toiletries were organized, towels neatly folded, glasses replaced, and we when we reentered the room everyday it looked like how it was when we first arrived.

We spent a lot of time by the large swimming pool basking in the sun. The place never felt crowded and we were able to secure chairs every time. The poolside service was efficient, pleasant, and attentive. Every staff member we encountered went above and beyond to make sure we were well cared for.

Other highlights were: the complimentary bottle of house wine from Solbar due to an unusual long wait, poolside service handing out iced treats, watching the Women’s World Cup by the pool, the spa facilities. I can go on and on.

This is an example of a hotel with amazing attention to detail, excellent service and impeccable style and design. There are so many places to visit in the world that I try to explore new rather than return to old, but Solage Calistoga is a place where I would return again and again to unwind.",
5,Superb spa in Calistoga,A place to have a couples time. We had a mud sllide and a few other services plus a time in the pool early enough to have a cabana. Try it a second day. Wonderful. We did not stay at the hotel but the spa services will exceptional as well as the facilities and the attention. We had massages on the second day. Will return.,
5,Luxury and tranquility - stunning place,"After a week of travelling the Pacific highway we arrived at the Solage. From the moment we checked in we felt we had arrived somewhere special. A warm welcome and iced tea served to us before being escorted to our lovely studio. The rooms are gorgeous, well appointed, good size & layout and extremely comfortable, I slept so well. The attention to detail in the amenities was excellent, fresh coffee, milk in the fridge, full size spa quality bathroom products, I especially loved the turndown service with the gorgeous bottles of mint water. During our stay we had a couples mud treatment in the spa which started off quite humorous throwing mud at each other but we soon chilled out and relaxed into the experience, my other half even fell asleep at the end. During our three day stay we used all the facilities, we even went on a bike ride which was fun. Quite simply we loved everything, the food, the wine, the spa and the service itself was always courteous and friendly. We were so chilled that we honestly didn't want to leave, the Solage is a very special place, luxurious, tranquil and truly relaxing, we just loved it.",
5,Simple luxury in Calistoga,"This was our second stay at Solage and it did not disappoint. The grounds are lovely, the service is exceptional, the spa is very nice, the workout facilities are probably the best we have ever experienced at any resort, ever (that says a lot- they even offer TRX classes- unheard of!) and Solbar is amazing. You could spend more to have some more exclusivity, but why? How much time do you really spend in your hotel room when you are in Calistoga? Probably not a lot. You want a nice, comfortable and well-appointed room, great food and spa/workout facilities onsite, and then you want to go taste wine. Solage has it all.",
5,Day of Spa relaxation!,"Beautiful, relaxing with every detail perfect! The spa experience was luxurious and full service. I felt relaxed and pampered. A little more explanation would have been helpful, since this was my first experience of a mud slide but overall a worthwhile experience. Try the refresher drinks at the spa bar they fill you with energy!",
1,Unbelievable,"I was just booking a spa treatment for me and my 2 girlfriends costing $115 each. Just as I was about to hang up, I was told that the hotel has an entrance fee for those not staying overnight at the hotel of $50 each! First of all, I have to give it to the reservationist for letting me know about this fee an not blindsiding me. But, for heavens sake, we are going to use your services and give you revenue! Why be greedy and get more? It's not like I am not spending anything at the hotel! Who knows, we might even get a drink/snack after the treatment but, because of what I think is very poor taste, we are walking away. $50 is such a small amount, it is the idea. So, you can have your hotel and I will take my unwelcome business elsewhere!",
5,Relaxed beauty,"Each individual cottage is beautiful and comfortable. A true California experience. Hot during the day, cool at night, who could ask for anything more. They do have a family pool and an adult pool, but clearly leaving the kids at home is preferred.",
5,Luxurious stay but pricey,"Solage is a lovely resort full of many luxuries, including great linens, spa water at turndown, a fantastic pool and full service spa. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay there, having decided to splurge for two nights at the end of a week stay in CA. The restaurant is very good with an incredible wine list but the meals are overpriced and better options can be found in the town of Calistoga or in nearby St. Helena. My massage and mud bath treatment was very nice but again, pricey. The service was excellent in all areas except the restaurant where we did have to wait several times at dinner for little things like bread service and a refill on water during the meal. Worth a visit if money is no object!",
5,Solage Calistoga,"Solage is one of the best resorts we have ever stayed at. We spent several nights at the establishment and would have loved to spend more. It is a sanctuary, where one becomes so relaxed, it seeps away all stress and eliminates all thoughts of life’s issues. The grounds are very well kept and are truly beautiful. Rooms are spacious and very well decorated. The staff is very courteous, friendly and helpful. Solbar, the restaurant, is amazing; fresh ingredients, very tasteful, and excellent service.
We had the pleasure to meet Mr. Marcus Mueller, the General Manager at Solage, and then it all became obvious. Mr. Mueller is an amazing man, and he is one GM that I would say leads by example. One can actually notice how passionate he is about his staff and the resort.
Yes, we are looking forward to return to Solage; a true sanctuary where one day relieves a lifetime’s worth of stress.",
5,"Great hotel, average spa","There should have been two reviews: one for the hotel and the other one for the spa. Let's start on a positive note - staying at Solage is a splurge, but it worth every penny they charge: sleek and stylish decor, beautiful rooms, probably the best sheets I have ever slept on! Just soaking in their huge mineral pool for few hours seems like a complete vacation.
This time, I decided to enhance my experience by adding a spa package: mud-bath and massage. As the whole place, the spa is beautifully designed. That is pretty much for the positive experience. The service felt rushed and superficial.
We got a package with the silly name, something like ""double your pleasure"" for $475 for two people. The package included a light lunch at Solbar (shared appetizer, two entrees, no alcohol), two 50-minute massages and two so-called ""mudslides"". Mudslide experience is nothing more than a fancy way of stretching a simple 20-min mud treatment into becoming the ""experience"" worth well over $100. After your 20 min are up, you are invited to soak in a mineral ""hydro-bath"" (same water as in their outdoor pool, and pretty much everywhere in Calistoga).
Just to add minutes to your service, you are then guided to relax in a Brookstone-type of a reclining vibrating chair. The whole ritual feels artificial and is totally overpriced, in my opinion.
The shea butter massage was basically a gentle application of a shea butter mixture. Although very pleasant and relaxing, the experience lacked an essential ingredient - the massage itself! The therapist was so arrogant and detached that I did not dare to demand some pressure. To cope with my disappointment, I promising myself that I would never allow to rip myself of another $500, and just tried to relax through the ""treatment"".
Conclusion: hotel - 5 stars, spa - 1 star for relaxing music, averaging 3 stars.",
4,A decent stay,"The hotel is contemporary designed with a touch of nature, conveniently located at the north of Napa. Staff are quite friendly and helpful, apart from the staff at the spa who was a bit blunt, which was the only turn-off. You better book in advance if you would like to experience their spa treatments during your stay, as it was quite full. We have dinner and breakfast at the Solbar, both foods and venue ambience are excellent and really worth a visit, although there are other attractive choices around Napa.",
5,A Perfect Stay,"This was a surprise anniversary get away from my husband and I was totally blown away. From our arrival to our departure everything was perfect. The property give you a sense of privacy yet is very welcoming. Their attention to detail is very evident from your room comfort (great linens & robes) to the interaction that you have with the personnel. We loved the bikes and definitely used them while we were there, they were so fun to ride. Everyone is very friendly and ready to help with anything you need.

The Spa & exercise facility is one of the best that we've seen. Loved the wonderful selection of daily exercise classes (great instructors), the spa changing rooms & amenities, spa treatments (the mudslide treatment is a must do) and the mineral pool and cabanas is the perfect place to relax. Also, hands down the best wifi I've ever experienced at a hotel.

We have stayed at some amazing properties and had great spa experiences, but this one hit mark for on all levels for me and I'm VERY picky. We've already decided that we will return.",
5,"Fantastic ""Leave It All Behind"" Getaway","We were visiting SF for a work trip and decided to stay a couple of extra days in Napa. We received a recommendation to stay at Solage Calistoga and we couldn't have been more pleased. The service is impeccable from the moment you enter the reception area. You quickly realize the ""laid back"" but comfortable atmosphere and you begin to relax immediately. We checked in, were escorted to our room and were very impressed with the individual ""cottage"" suites. A large bedroom with a beautiful view of the grounds, iPads in each room for all your information, large bathroom area and your own personal bicycles outside of your room for all your local ""transportation"" needs. The pool is large and with a multitude of patio chairs and attentive staff to be sure your needs are met.

We took the bikes into town that evening and had a fantastic meal and of course, a wonderful bottle of wine. The town of Calistoga is like stepping back in time with great shops with beautifully decorated storefronts. The people are friendly and welcoming and you can quickly feel at home here.

The spa was a wonderful experience as we booked a couples massage. The attendants were very talented and experienced and we both were completely relaxed after our hour on the table. We didn't get time to enjoy the rest of the spa as a winery tour was in our plans for that afternoon but we could have easily spent the entire afternoon at the spa.

We had dinner at the Sol Restaurant the next evening and the food was fantastic and the service was even better. Our waiter did a wonderful job of making sure we had everything we needed.

If you are looking to get away form the hustle and bustle of the world, I would highly recommend this resort.",
5,Understated Perfection.,"My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Solage for 3 nights and 4 days. From the minute we arrived, we felt completely welcomed and totally indulged in the kind of way that makes you feel wonderful, not overwhelmed. To a person, we were treated with kindness, generosity and a total commitment to service. The rooms are luscious in a high-thread count kind of way, complete with great pillows, a sumptuous bed, big shower, great toiletries, minted water at night, a perfect morning coffee terrace just for us, and everything else you could want.
The spa...ahh, the spa..Amazing. Even if you just want to float around in the hot springs pool or sit on a relaxing divan and watch the water flow down the sculpture in the center courtyard, you will feel transported. I slept like a baby, and I don't sleep at night very well.
We biked to tons of vineyards (recommend Duck Horn, Round Pond, and doing the salon tasting at Swanson) and hiked up an old mine trail. We swam in the massive and gorgeous Solage pool and dined at the hotel's amazing Solbar. (Have the shrimp wraps for lunch!)
It is clear that the philosophy of the resort is that service matters and that guests are vitally important to the hotel's ability to thrive. Guests will return if they feel had a great time, which we did, and so we will, again and again.",
5,Fantastic mud spa experience,"Went there for a day by the pool whilst on our honeymoon in Napa. Had a mudslide as a couple in a lovely private room where you apply volcanic ash paste mixed with essential oils over your entire body and relax on a heated stone platform. At the end of the mud session, overhead showers rinse it off and you move to another room to soak in a bath with essential oils. Finally, you get to relax in a music chair room. Total relaxation experience worth every penny!",
3,"Very nice resort, but could have been a better experience....","My husband and I spent two nights at the Solage in a Vega King Studio suite in May. Overall a good stay, but had a few issues that kept me from giving it 5 stars. The property itself is very nice. The suites are free standing units scattered across the resort. The rooms are lovely. Comfortable, large King beds and really big spa like bathrooms. You also have your own patio/sitting area in front of your suite. There are bicycles for your use at the suite. We utilized them when going to different areas on the property. The pool area is wonderful! There is an adult pool and a separate family pool. The adult pool area was quiet and very relaxing. Not crowded at all during the time we were there. Service at the pool was very good. We had lunch by the pool that was good.

We had breakfast and dinner at the Solbar restaurant at the property. I highly recommend the restaurant. It was soooo good! Both breakfast and dinner were fantastic! Nice wine selection as well.

We also utilized the spa and had the couples massage. The massages were OK...maybe I was expecting it to be a little better considering how expensive it was....there was nothing wrong with it - but I have definitely had much better. The spa area itself is nice. There is a separate pool area with cabanas. We hung out by the spa pool after our messages and that was relaxing.

The biggest issue with our stay was the noise at night. Since the units have the outdoor patio areas, we unfortunately found that people staying around us did not know how to observe any type of ""quiet time"" at night. There were people outside listening to music, laughing, and talking loudly into the early morning hours. On the second night I had to call the front desk because it was 3AM and they were still going strong. I know this is not the fault of the property, however I realized that there were no notices about observing ""quiet time"" when outside after a certain hour or not playing music outside on your patio after a certain hour. While this should be a common respect that people display when they know they are outside on a patio right beside of others... unfortunately there are many people who don't have this respect. When you stay at a place like the Solage with your husband, you are wanting a relaxing, romantic environment - not to be woken up by people partying every night. After we called about the issue the second night, I do think that someone from the office came out and spoke with our neighbors - however I was disappointed that we were not even given an apology by management.

In summary, I loved the property itself, but because of the noise issue it was not the relaxing stay that I wanted and I would unfortunately be hesitant to go back.",
5,"Lovely property, stellar service","We spent three nights here in June. The facilities are gorgeous, wonderful pool and clean, elegant rooms with very good quality mini bar/coffee amenities (local coffee, so good! And there's real half and half in the mini bar as opposed to the fake creamers!), spacious bathrooms with dressing area, turn down service that leaves fresh water and a chocolate, great food in the Lounge and pool area, all staff lovely especially Jeff and the pool team! Cannot recommend enough.",
5,Spectacular,"Oh wow, I'm not sure where to start. Getting there wasn't easy (the traffic from SFO was horrendous....my friends flew in to Sacramento and it was SO much easier) but, once I arrived it was all good. I didn't even have to get out of my car to check in (or out). They brought me bottles of ice cold water and then led me to my cottage, unloaded the car and wanted to know what else they could do for me. I went to dinner with my friends and the meal was sublime. And, of course, the wine was the best. My cottage was roomy and comfortable and my patio was private. The place looks spread out (it's all cottages) but, in reality, I was able to get to the cottages of everyone who was there with us (we were there for a wedding) easily. The pool was great (we used the kiddy pool having a 2 year old with us- there is an adults only pool), toured the spa (no time to use it, unfortunately) and ate most of our meals there. The wedding setting couldn't have been lovelier (a ""sunken"" lawn area surrounded by a flower garden with the mountains as a back drop), the reception was in a large room right next to the garden and included a large outdoor seating area. The staff had signs posted at all access points that this was a private event and we had no crashers that I was aware of. I can't say enough about how wonderful the location, entire set-up and staff was. They were out of sight most of the time unless you needed something and then they appeared, as if by magic, to cater to your every wish. We will be going back for a 5 day ""girls"" trip to take advantage of the spa and all the fitness classes. Oh, and every cabin comes with bicycles. It's about a mile of flat road to town which has much to offer in food, wine tasting and art galleries. There is also a shuttle to many of the wineries in the area and many have an agreement with Solage so you get a reduced rate as a Solage guest. The wifi was free but of average speed. But then, we only used our cells or iPads....I never unpacked my computer.",
4,A good place for couples,"This is more of an adult ""couples facility"" than for families with kids. A good wine selection which, from prior visits, seems to change seasonally or perhaps more often. Service has always been slightly above average for the area and price, and the facilities clean.",
5,Great resort in beautiful wine country,"We stayed here at recommendation of some good friends who live in the area. Unfortunately we both had a dose of flu so were not feeling at our best!

The restaurant is wonderful with some really great wines and champagne too.

All the facilities you would expect with a great spa plus they have a few sports cars you can pre-book and use as part of your daily rate.

Staff wonderfully trained and very attentive so give it a try, you won't regret it!",
5,Fantastic property in the middle of wine country,"I cannot use enough superlatives to describe this property. And, it is hard for me to identify the best aspect of the property because it was all great: The pool? - relaxing and beautiful; The cottage? - cute, clean, well equipped and relaxing; The spa? refreshing and relaxing; The food? Simply awesome with a great variety; The drinks? AWESOME!

Overall, one of the best stays that I have ever had!",
5,Awesome Stay,"Amazing 24 hour stay here. Beautiful grounds, great room. Loved the food at the restaurant, especially the amazing service by Scott Turnball and Laura. They took such great care of us can't wait to go back.",
5,Fabulous retreat,"Solage is wonderfully simple yet elegant. Surrounded by nature, this elegant little resort has all the amenities required for a peaceful and relaxing retreat. We found the restaurant to be exceptional, the lunge area to be relaxed and casual and the service staff well trained and responsive.",
5,Sister Spa Experience,"My sister and I have stayed at Solange in the past. The property is beautiful and the spa, pools, restaurant are top notch. Last year we tried another resort nearby. As a result, we came to appreciate the great parking, ease of arrival and departure, and pedestrian friendly grounds at Solange.

My sister and I came to Solange from different parts of the US. We come to catch up, visit, and be pampered. This year we were there at a holiday (by mistake because we did not look closely at the calendar). In spite of a lot of families, a big wedding, 100% capacity, and having a room by the pool (our request) - there was not a lot of noise and we had another wonderful visit.

This resort is pricey but well worth it - we definitely got what we paid for

Will be back next year!",
5,Luxurious Serenity,"Arriving at Solage transformed me to a state of tranquility. We had just finished a road trip that took us from San Francisco to Yosemite to Lake Tahoe and now were mellowing out in Napa Valley. Located just outside the town of Calistoga at the northern end of the Napa Wine Valley. On a quiet road (Silverado Trail) and surrounded by hills and mountain views. The property consists of individual cottages with private seating out back. We stayed in their basic unit with fireplace. Sufficient in size although not grande in proportion, the room had a great bed, amenities and a lovely bathroom area with separate tub and shower. We were located a 3 minute walk to the main area of the enormous heated outdoor pool and bar area. Adjacent to the Michelin star rated Solbar and office. We had the dining package that included breakfast and we also enjoyed dinner one night. The made to order breakfast was simply wonderful (definitely try the lemon ricotta pancakes and don't forget to order a box of warm cinnamon rolls (Hint: ask for a little fresh blueberry jam on the side and you have the perfect jelly donut. Dinner was equally outstanding- the the wild pacific salmon could have been the best tasting seafood dinner we've ever had. All the dishes were beautifully plated. Let's talk about the Spa. Oh my God!. Once through the appointment desk and store you enter a tranquil garden waiting area with very comfortable couches and seating to await your appointment. All the staff were extremely professional and don't forget a dip in the also large thermal pool. As a hotel guest you can enjoy sitting and dipping in both the main pool and the Spa pool. The staff throughout the facility were all extremely knowledgeable and everyone had a smile and was gracious to the guests. The waiters, the front desk, the concierge, the Spa personnel, and even the grounds personnel were quite professional and there to please. A few extra hints: while Solbar restaurant on grounds is definitely worth a visit, Napa Valley boats many great restaurants. We tried and loved Redd in Yountville. (Reservations for most restaurants are 60 days in advance so don't forget to call) Really beautifully prepared food, great taste, and for the area, not insane pricing. (average entree was $30 and average appetizer was $15 and desserts were $8.) Don't be put off by the reasonable for the area prices, this is a top shelf restaurant. We tried two wineries that I would recommend: Cade and Spring Mountain. Both with beautiful views, knowledgeable personnel and generous tastings. Cade provides a tour of their caves where the barrels are located with a talk on the process. This is an ultramodern winery in a magnificent setting. Spring Mountain provides a more informative talk on the workings of a winery with regards to he planting and tending the vines. Between the two you get a very good picture of the entire process and taste some really good wines. Both are located within 20 minutes of Solage. Looking for a get away with a beautiful setting, top notch amenities and a terrific staff, this is the place to be. By the way, did I mention that each cottage comes with two bicycles for your enjoyment!",
5,Super luxury retreat,"We stayed here for two nights as part of our honeymoon recently.

The resort is beautiful, the gardens and pool are stunning, the welcome was wonderful, all the staff were very professional and helpful. We were lucky enough to be upgraded to a Adara Studio which had a fireplace, a beautiful terrace overlooking the oak grove, and an amazing bathroom.

Everything about the resort really is 5 star, but in particular the pool and spa were the best bits. The pool has a gorgeous view, is really big and has lots of beds. The thermal spa is also wonderful, I only wish the jacuzzis weren't separated into men and women's only. We also had the mudslide treatment in the spa which was super relaxing and fun.

Our only disappointment at Solage was the food at Solbar, for a 1 star restaurant, of which we'd read good reviews the food just wasn't up to standard. In particular we had the fried chicken special one night and it was quite disappointing to say the least. The restaurant service was also quite slow at times, however the staff were lovely and the setting beautiful.",
5,Beautiful place but outstanding cuisine,"Talk about paradise! This beautiful resort may be a bit out of the way but it is situated in a most scenic region, landscaped beautifully with a magnificent pool and one of the best restaurants in the region. If you stay for breakfast don't miss the Meyer lemon ricotta pancakes! Basic bicycles are available for local touring or riding into town, and a 6 km running circuit circles the resort. Our only disappointment was the room decor - although each unit was clean, spacious and quite private with a nice indoor and outdoor sitting area, the interior was unimaginably boring. Totally unredeeming for a place of this calibre. That aside we would return.",
5,Always an Amazing Get Away!!!`,"I always love staying here. We first went there on a company retreat, but now I find it difficult to stay anywhere else. Their spa is amazing, food is outstanding and the little cottages with free bikes to ride is impressive. The bathrooms are heavenly with a peaceful bubbly soaking disk and the spa has an incredible cucumber eye cream that is addictive. At times, you can even rent a Mercedes for a few hours, free of charge!",
5,Nurse your hangover from this beautiful spa!,"This resort is very relaxing and beautiful. The staff is extremely helpful and food was excellent at their on-site restaurant. They have several gluten free options.

We stayed for two nights and wished we had book another. You need to block out some time to spend at the spa. We had the signature mudslide. It was okay, but I would rather have had a massage. The pool / steam room which is included with your room stay was beautiful and I wish we had more time to enjoy it.",
5,Beautiful hotel in wine country,"We had a firm retreat at Solage. It was a lovely spot. The rooms were private, spacious and modern. I loved the over-size shower with the pebble floor. Every room has its own private terrace and comes with two mountain bikes. Our group meals were excellent and very fresh, with wonderful salads.",
5,Stay more than one night!,"We have been looking at the property for years and just never stayed. However, this after tax season excursion my BF decided to keep it local and indulge me with wine and spa treatments. We requested a secluded room for quiet and privacy, they delivered. We had a King Studio, perfect for just the two of us. The property is beautiful, and the service superb. Everyone was helpful and happy to be there. Each unit is supplied with two bikes, we went into town our first day. The second day we stayed on property and enjoyed the Bathhouse and private, clothing optional pools. What a treat! I used the fitness facility signing up for classes each day of my stay. Solage has so much to offer, take the time and enjoy every bit!",
5,Amazing spa!,"My girlfriend and I booked this great weekend getaway, and we decided on this gorgeous spa to be pampered with all day treatments. First, let me say that Eli-the bath house manager is top knotch! A true professional!
After a slight glitch in our original reservation (due to construction) our massage/facials, mudslide treatments, mineral baths and the piece de resistance-THE ZERO GRAVITY chairs to end our day, our experience was truly amazing! Not only did we have the entire bath house to our selves, but the service from start to finish was superb, and all of the emmenities were five star. And, because there were a few mix ups in our original reservation, Eli gave us both a generous discount and complimentary champagne....way to win a girl over Eli! .
And I can't forget to mention this...As someone who gets regular massages due to my profession, I would HIGHLY recommend Tim for a massage. He has the perfect touch and he is extremely professional.
I can't wait to book my next vacation to NoCal and stay at the resort!!
Overall, AMAZING! Thank you Solage!",
5,A great stay. Un hotel meraviglioso,"Definitely I'm in love with this place, it' true love. First I want to thank you Marcus Mueller, the general manager, for his hospitality and then all the hotel and Solbar staff. If you need to relax yourself and phisically and mentally reborn Solage Calistoga is the right place",
5,Excellent stay as always,"Great location, excellent food and the service is first rate. The new restaurant/bar design is an improvement on the old layout and the new manager Marcus Mueller is making his presence felt with a personal touch. We look forward to our next visit!",
4,Luxurious but I didn't pay!,"Won four nights at this hotel. Really lovely. Staff extremely friendly, so although it was posh it was not in any way too formal. Added bonuses are (a) the bikes throughout the hotel allowing you to cycle to the spa, pool, reception, restaurant and rooms....but also as far outside of the complex as you might like (b) the availability of four high performance Mercs on a first come / first served basis to get you around the valley in style!

Beware though, anything you purchase (including spa treatment) costs 20% more than the advertised (already steep) price with the addition of gratuities.",
3,Totally Overpriced,"We have just completed a 3 night stay at the Solage. Totally not worth the $520 rate per night which excludes breakfast. There are plenty of other hotels in Calistoga or Napa that are far more reasonably priced. Our beds/pillows were uncomfortable therefore sleep quality was poor; not great considering this is an area you don't spend much time in the hotel so the one thing you do was a good nights sleep! The Spa is as overpriced as the nighty rate. The Solbar is excellent and definitely a visit even if you are not staying at the hotel, the fish tacos are a must try.",
5,Better than expected,"We expected Solage to be nice, but it exceeded every expectation. The room was impeccable, as was the cleanliness and upkeep. The staff could not have been more helpful. The food was excellent from breakfast to dinner. Having bikes to jaunt around town was an added bonus. Our spa experience was one of the best we've had. Every detail was covered. We will recommend and come back whenever possible, Well done Solage.",
5,Can't wait to return!,"My husband and I took our daughter to Napa Valley to celebrate her 21st birthday over Easter weekend. We are so happy to have chosen to stay at Solage. The property is beautiful with a relaxed feel and in a great area. The entire staff is helpful, friendly, and professional. The rainy, cooler weather didn't hamper us too much..... We enjoyed riding the cruiser bikes, dining outside at Solbar (what a fabulous restaurant!) with heaters, and relaxing in the spa pools. Flor, at the spa desk, was there with a smile every time we popped in there, and was very nice and helpful. Kathy the Concierge provided prompt responses to our questions or requests and, before arrival, had booked a fantastic balloon ride for us with Napa Valley Balloons Inc. Our servers at Solbar were awesome! Come to think of it, so were the hostesses, the valet parkers, the front desk staff, the bartenders, and everyone else! Next to the spa is a well-equipped work out facility and a separate studio for daily group exercise classes. The pool looked lovely -- although the weather kept us from spending time there. Our room with two queen beds and big bath was spacious and comfortable. Our winery recommendation: Do the private Summit Experience at Pride Mountain. Restaurant recommendations: Solbar for all meals, Auberge du Soleil (make 6pm reservations on the Terrace and watch the sunset), and Mustards. We really loved everything about Solage and can't wait to return!",
5,Blown away!,"Just returned from a magical weekend at Solage in Calistoga. The resort is super luxurious, the grounds are gorgeous and the guest experience was one of the most well planned I’ve ever encountered.

Check-in was a breeze. We didn’t even need to get out of our car. Friendly valets greeted us as we pulled up, checked us in curbside and delivered room keys pronto. We arrived in our Atlas Studio to find a spacious corner room with high ceilings and a perfect mix of indoor/outdoor living space. The room was designed and well stocked for comfort and I especially loved the ample lavender skincare products, hefty jug of fresh half and half in the fridge for our morning coffee, toasty bathroom floor and beautiful shower inlaid with smooth stones.

Black cruiser bikes served as our wheels all weekend, taking us to the pool, the spa and even into town (locks provided). We took full advantage of the fitness classes which were surprisingly challenging, and the mudslide experience at the spa was out of this world. Don’t miss it – it’s a ridiculously fun couples experience (though I’d love an option on the mudslide to take the last step in silence). The main pool was a fun people watching zone and the food at the restaurant utterly delicious.

Overall our stay was delightful. I’d return in an instant!",
5,5 days at the beautiful Solage resort,"I just returned from short Birthday/Anniversary vacation at the beautiful Solage resort in Napa, California. Let me begin by saying that their customer service is way up there with some of the top hotels I have ever stayed at. They practically fall all over themselves to make your stay more pleasant. The property is beautifully located... it has a lovely open and airy feel to it...very California.....scenic and simply gorgeous...and we (my family of three) were given an amply sized bungalow with two Queen beds and a patio leading to a lush high-grassed woodsy area...perfect for our little Chihuahua who was greeted royally with treats and water bowls and a comfy doggie bed. They even brought us a basket so she could sit in it while we biked her around...she felt very pampered...as did we! there were are few snafus along the way: the thermostat didn't quite work properly...and although it was ""fixed"" it still dipped down to 60 degrees overnight although we had set it to 70. Some heaters that were brought by personnel at Solbar so we could enjoy sitting outside while having our late breakfast were not able to be made to work no matter how hard they tried (there were three of them....not one worked!)....and my highly anticipated hot air balloon ride booked through the hotel suddenly got cancelled at the very last minute (after we had risen and gotten ready for it at 4.00am....) but, this really is not the hotel's fault...and they more than made it up to us with all kinds of treats and xras. Kathy, the Concierge was especially helpful and lovely as was Eli at the Spa (which is amazing, by the way)....these two really went the extra mile to make sure we were happy and satisfied....but there were so many others whose names now escape me who also went out of their way to ensure a lovely holiday! oh..and dinner at Solbar....wonderful!!! We really enjoyed our time at the Solage and will be sure to return again.
I have two comments that might be helpful to the hotel to maybe improve the customer's experience....the rainshower could use more water pressure...it's difficult to rinse the shampoo out of your hair if you have long hair....also, the mirrors were definitely fat mirrors (you ladies know what I mean)...who needs to look fatter when on holiday in Napa???",
5,Wow!,"Solage Calistoga is a wonderful, romantic, relaxing hotel. We loved the pool, the food was absolutely incredible and the spa was great. The rooms were amazing- very cool, modern. The grounds were well landscaped- fragrant herbs, bushes and plants - just beautiful. We were visiting with our entire family- would have enjoyed it if we were there without the kids. Would love to get the chance to return for more relaxation.",
5,Wine Country Delight,"This was my 3rd stay at Solage and probably the best! I booked the room on Jetsetter, a standard Vega Studio, and was nervous they would give me a crappy room because I had such a discounted rate. That was definitely not the case! We had a great room near the pool.

To be honest, one of the reasons this stay was so great was the weather...warm and sunny and pool-inducing. So, we got to take advantage of the pool and the hot tub.

We also ate at Solbar for dinner and breakfast. They've just finished their big remodel of the interior and it is very elegant. Great bar, great service. 4 of us had dinner on Sat night and our server Scott was terrific. All of our apps were 5 star although the entrees fell a little short. Dessert made up for it and hit 5 stars again.

We also borrowed one of their Mercedes Benz, they have a fleet of cars available on a first come first served basis, so that was super fun to drive down the Silverado Trail.

All in all, a terrific and relaxing stay and we'll definitely be back for a 4th visit.",
5,Romantic getaway,"My husband and I visited Napa for the first time and I must say we could not get enough of it.
As we both enjoy a good wine, fine dining and a beautiful hotel this place exceeded all of our expectations.
As we pulled up to the hotel we were greeted outside and checked in for the convenience of not having to get out of our car!!! Then we were given the option of driving several different Mercedes Benz vehicles during our stay complimentary of the hotel! We did in fact take them up on that offer.
Our room was fabulous and cozy. There was so much privacy and relaxation at this place. The bathroom was very big as well as the room. The pool area was beautiful as well as brunch at the Sol Bar. It was one of the best I've had.
The staff was super attentive and went out of their way to please their guests. I felt that the wait staff in Sol Bar for brunch and dinner were excellent .
We made use of the bikes outside our room and rode into town for lunch.
There is nothing negative I can say about this place.
You get what you pay for. We will be back !",
4,Relaxing weekend at Solage,"Things I loved: The spa - great treatments and service - the most relaxed I have been in a long time! The cruiser bikes available to guests. The large bathrooms and the river rock floors in the showers. The large room size and the comfortable beds. The decor and the landscaping. The staff was very welcoming and helpful.

Things that were just ok: The bath products in the rooms are average. Clean-up in and around the pool area at the spa was a little slow.",
2,Spa-only review and do not recommend mud treatment,"My two daughters in their twenties and I recently visited the Solage Spa to try a Mud treatment, as Calistoga is known for it's detoxifying, relaxing mud baths. The Solage Spa women's locker room has just been renovated and we were able to use it, which was nice. It is up to date and nice, but nothing special. The spa greeting was confusing and abrupt. We had to pay upfront including a mandatory 20% tip and I had to carry my credit card in my robe to order any food or beverages. Again, not high-end treatment, although our smoothy was $11. We mistakenly did not read about the 3-step treatment on the website and no one shared the process, although we did tell them it was our first time at the spa.

The mud treatment consists of a self-application of mud from a bucket with ash and essential oil in a heated communal shower room. There were 3 towels and water on the ledge for us to relax while the mud caked on us. After 15-20 minutes a man knocked on the door and we were told to wash off. He knocked again and we walked to soaking tubs in an unembellished room. We sat in the tub for 15-20 minutes (no music) until he knocked again. We re-robed (yes, they were now wet) and went to a room with semi reclined chair and a comforter. We placed headphones on our ears and sat in this ""vibrating"" chair for 15 minutes. Yes, the base from the music caused a little vibration if you turned up the volume, but then that hurt my ears. The final knock from the man was for us to get out and get dressed.

The manager claims it is their signature treatment. Our skin was not softer nor did we feel treated to anything.",
5,Hard to top in the wine country,"It's closer in than it's sister property Calistoga Ranch, so if you want to ride a bike into town and be a little closer to the action, this is probably a better bet. Love the pool. Can't really say anything bad about this place but it is pricey...",
5,Amazing.,Beautiful place. Rooms are stunning- beds super comfortable with lovely linens. Luxurious bathrooms - food is divine. Staff super friendly and helpful. Exercise classes are awesome. 2nd visit - will return soon!,
5,Relax & Unwind,"This was our first trip to Napa Valley. We had a wonderful stay at the Solage. We were with a group and did have a good discounted rate. It would not be worth paying full rack rate.

Order room service in morning. Worth it to eating on the patio.

The suite was lovely. Do stay in a suite with a view other than the privacy fence. We looked out over an open field.

Loved the making coffee each morning with the fresh groud coffee.",
3,Solage has lost it's luster,"I went to Solage for a girls birthday weekend at the end of February. As someone that stays in boutique hotels frequently, I would say to temper your expectation - they are overpriced for what you get.

When we arrived after a day of wine tasting, we checked in, put our bags down and went to go play bocce ball. We checked with the hostess to see if we needed to order drinks at the bar and bring them over to play, or if someone could take our order - they told us that we could start playing and someone would come over. It took them 15 minutes to come over - and then they got the order incorrect. We were almost done with our game by the time our drinks finally came.

That night we ate in the main dining room. The menu split into hearty and healthy. Our meal was ""ok"" - I would not say it was the best meal I have had. It is VERY expensive. Our waiter was amazing - but as I found during my stay - the service is very hit or miss. They forgot to add a birthday candle to our dessert for the b-day girl - just one of the details they missed.

The next morning we woke up early to go to the spa. Just to be clear - the locker rooms are closed due to renovations. There is nowhere to change. When you check in - they give you a bag with a robe and sandals. One of us was not getting a treatment, but just going to the thermal pools. She was not given a bag. I am not sure why, but just another example of the service.

The massages were booked for 10am, but when we arrived told they were 10:15am. One of the massages didn't even last the whole time.

The thermal pools are nice - but they were filled with leaves - I wondered if they had even cleaned the grounds that morning. When I left, I wanted to change out of my wet bathing suit before grabbing lunch. There is no suit spinner or plastic bag (details!) and I had to change in the single bathroom.

The lounge/meeting area at the pool looked like it hadn't been touched since the day before either. Cushions askew and tree bark and leaves everywhere. (details!)

If were to make a suggestion - cleanliness in the pool area is a MUST. In the midst of long-term construction I would suggest a temporary locker room in a tent. I would offer smoothies as a ""thank you for your understanding during construction"" - there is no excuse for a spa experience to not have been thought through - perhaps one of the employees should have a spa day and experience it as a customer.

When we mentioned to the Spa management the 1. confusion about apt times, 2. massage not lasting long enough 3. conditions of the facilities were not clean - she actually argued that we ""agreed"" to it. She eventually gave us a slight discount, but again - that is not the service you would expect at this caliber of resort. I would expect to see staff being extra attentive.

When then went to lunch asked for a later checkout (they extended it 1 hour). Our server at lunch was amazing - but the bus boys started clearing our table before we were even finished (details!).

The rooms are quite nice - I love the coffee maker and outdoor seating area - but guess what? At exactly 1pm - the front desk knocked on our door to see if we were on our way out (details!)

As The Four Seasons is scheduled to open across the street - I would suggest Solage have a serious look at their pricing in conjunction with the service. At those prices, we should be leaving raving about how effortless and top notch the service was.",
5,EVEN BETTER WITHOUT AUBERGE!!!!!,"Having been a regular customer at this beautiful property for many years I have been following its change recently. Having just departed I have to say that it was better than ever before. The gardens looked cleaner and more taken care of, the staff was friendlier and more attentive than ever before. The new restaurant is stunning as well as everything else. The Bar is awesome and the folks are so nice.

Looking at the previous reviews here about bringing back Auberge, I can't think of any reason for that. The place has never been better and the only ones to want Auberge back is probably Auberge themselves. I can understand as they lost their best hotel out of them all. They seem to loose a lot of hotels recently. I think it is six in one year!!! That speaks for itself.

I say keep up the good work Solage and can't wait to be back. You are my favorites!!!!!",
5,A relaxing two-night weekend getaway from San Francisco for couples,"The Solage grounds and amenities are beautiful. I appreciate that there is a separate ""family pool,"" and the main pool is very large and ideal for swimming laps. The gym has reformer Pilates classes, and guided meditation classes that I enjoyed.

The rooms/cottages are a good size and come with bicycles you can use.

The service was very personal, and the concierge Kathy have us some fantastic recommendations for nearby wineries to bike to. We went to Bennett Lane and Tedeschi, and had a great time.

I recommend staying for at least two nights so you can make the most of the hotel and area.",
5,Amazing stay in Calistoga,"This is our 6th stay at Solage. Beautifully landscaped grounds. Spacious, modern yet elegant rooms that are almost like mini apartments with patios, coffee maker and very comfy bed. The staff is outstanding and service is on par with other high end hotels. (Think Four Seasons, St Regis) Solage has a warm and friendly vibe. Very relaxing and great location to explore the valley. The bar and lounge food is outstanding as is the breakfast. Best smoked salmon and bagel anywhere!
We'll be back next year!",
5,Can't wait to come back!,This place was recommended by a good friend with good taste. Very happy with our stay. The service was great. The rooms were so nice and comfortable - our patio faced the sunset. The staff was very helpful and nice. Spent some time in the mineral baths and sauna after a long day of wine tasting (hard life) and it was perfect. Definitely returning in the near future! Definitely recommending to my friends and family.,
3,Riding on the coat tails of its old reputation,"Ahh, the Solage in Calistoga used to be our special place which is why I am truly bummed to write this review. When we needed a weekend away from the city we'd head up there for peace and quiet and exquisite service. I didn't realize they had spun off from Auberge prior to our last visit, which explains the decline in management/service. I want to be clear here- heading up to the Solage is (was?) a treat. Spending nearly $700 on one night away for dinner and accommodations is a TREAT, a special occasion. So when I get there, I want it to be flawless and I just want to be in a calm, sweet, unbothered mood.

My email confirmation said check-in time was 3pm, we got there at 3 and they told us check-in wasn't until 4pm (I still have that confirmation email, and wish I had shown the manager, but I was trying to be polite) Hmm, ok. So we went to the pool to have a swim and relax and wait. By the time they told us our room was ready it 4:45. We got to the room and it smelled heavily of smoke. So we asked for another room. We had to wait for another 30 minutes while they found us a room that didn't smell like a chimney. By the time we were settled in our new room it 5:45. No complaints once we were in the room though. The next morning we woke up and decided to hit up yoga/ the gym, and then head to breakfast. On our way to breakfast I swung past reception to ask for an extended check out, since we had such a late start on our stay the day before. The lady at reception said all she could offer me was an extra 30 minutes, which is just ridiculous. Once she saw how upset I was she said she could accommodate an hour extension. Good grief, this is not a negotiation. And heres the best part, we went back to the room to relax after after breakfast and housekeeping came into the room TWICE in that hour. Way to communicate with the rest of your team. When you're paying this much for a stay at a ""lux"" resort, these types of mistakes shouldn't be happening and in fact, they hadn't happened any of the previous times we'd stayed at the Solage in the past. Previously, management would send champagne to our room for no reason at all or if they found out we were celebrating something, give you chai tea upon check-in, if they saw you playing bocce they'd send over some wine to make the game a little more fun, people would call to check in with us to make sure we had everything we needed, and it just felt like a more smoothly run, thoughtful operation. Like I wrote in my title, Now I just feel like they're riding on their own coat tails of what they used to be. Is this a nice property? Yes. Its gorgeous and quiet and romantic and lovely. Is it deserving of 5 stars? Definitely not. For what it is, it has become average. And you know what? In not one of the conversations I had while I was there, did anyone I spoke to apologize for the inconveniences. (Save for the housekeeper, and it wasn't even her fault!)

I have to say- SpaSolage and SolBar are not included in this review. They are both still fabulous, and I will continue to head up there for the day to soak in the mineral pool and eat at the restaurant but it'll be a while before I consider staying at the hotel again.",
4,What happened to this once awesome place?,"We eagerly awaited our return to Solage after two years, but the excitement of the anticipation soon turned out in disappointment. What happened to this once fabulous gateway?
- first time we checked in right away. Now we waited for a call from reception at the pool until 4.15 to realize they forgot to call. Our room was by the spa, facing open space, now it faced the back of a different building and we could blissfully hear the kids nearby. Not to mention- no bottle of welcome Mumm, or keys of a convertible Mercedes were on the offer the second time...
- first time we loved Solbar, the entire package was perfect...Now, the waiter didn't understand the order in which we wanted the dishes served, so we had to send the food back twice; one hour into the meeting we were still eating corn muffins; finally, other than the deserts, the crab salad and the corn muffins, the food was poorly executed- for a Michelin star. The service was slow- had to ask for extra plates twice, the table wasn't cleaned regularly, etc. Having eaten here before and knowing how a Michelin star should be we couldn't help but wonder how soon they will lose the star...The service should simply be impeccable and food innovative and flawless, i can think of 10 places in the area where you can actually eat better...
All in all, the weather was glorious, the pools remain gorgeous and wine country is still a great place to relax, but instead of eagerly planning our third return to Solage, we are looking at other options.",
5,Honeymoon Bliss,"My wife and I visited the Solage Calistoga for our honeymoon over the Christmas holiday. What a lovely place! The food is excellent, and the service was wonderful. We were greeted by an incredibly welcoming staff and immediately given the most delicious chai tea I've ever drank (we even got the recipe). We then made our way to our room which was peaceful and cozy; equipped with a fireplace and a large soaking tub that helped us shed any residual wedding planning stress.

If I could choose one word to describe Solage it would be: serenity. The grounds are peaceful, well maintained, and quiet. The Spa is lovely. We had a couple's massage and then did the mudbath/soaking experience. The resort was crowded for the holidays, but the staff did an excellent job of making your feel cared for by providing what felt like a very individualized experience. I was impressed at how it could really provide for all types of guests: a lesbian couple (us), older couples, families, etc.

Also, the Mercedes rental program is an interesting perk. We decided to borrow one the vehicles for the day, and while we would not typically partake in something like that we just decided why not?! It was our honeymoon after all! It was fun to drive around Napa Valley in a convertible for the afternoon and live a life that seems only real in movies.

Finally the food. Their restaurant is Michelin rated, so obviously it's really tasty. We had breakfast in the morning as part of out package, and it was delicious. We at dinner their Christmas Day, and it was just superb. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu.

Bottom Line: While the Solage may be in the more northern part of Napa Valley, we liked having that added privacy. Nothing is too far of a drive, and you can do it in style when borrowing one of the Mercedes. It was a great way for us to experience Napa for the first time! We will most certainly be back!",
3,"Really Good, but...","Took my wife here for her babymoon because of the spa and the Michelin restaurant on property. My main goal with the trip was for us to have a relaxing weekend together, let her have some spa time and have delicious food. We just completed the weekend and all was achieved, but found there were hiccups at the spa and restaurant during our stay that could easily have been avoided. Maybe it was a case of bad timing/luck for us during our stay. In the end, we felt relaxed and enjoyed our time (mission accomplished), but left feeling the service we received at the spa and restaurant made us question the level of quality promoted by the resort.

1) Reception - Reception was very welcoming. Offered us chai tea and water. Thanked us for choosing them for our babymoon, confirmed our reservations at the spa, and reviewed the ""Just the Two of Us"" package we purchased. The welcome packet included our spa itineraries which was helpful because we forgot our reservation times.
2) Room - Our Adara Studio was great. The layout and high ceilings made it feel large and open. The bath products smelled great. My wife enjoyed the bath salts provided when she took a bath. The bed was really comfortable and helped with us feeling relaxed.
3) Solbar Restaurant - The food here was beyond delicious. Our waiter on our first night was great. He told us highlights about the restaurant and noted its Michelin rating. We thoroughly enjoyed our meal. The portions were great and frankly more than we expected. We returned for breakfast on day two of babymoon for another delicious meal. The donuts were awesome and softer than pillows used by angels. Dinner on night two was drastically different and very frustrating. We sat in the bar area and our waiter:
a) forgot to put our order in after we waited nearly an hour and asked about the status of our dishes upon seeing two separate groups which arrived after my/our second drink order receive their food orders
b) repeated our order to him (which he wrote down the first time) and he had to return a minute later to confirm the wrong dish
c) we asked what could be prepared quickly for us while we waited for our meal to be prepared, he suggested the kale chips, which we ordered and asked to get while we wait
d) despite our request to bring out dishes one after another and the kale chips before our meal, all three came at the same time
e) when the waiter described the desserts, it was apparent he didn't know how to properly describe them because what he described was nothing like what I had the night before
f) I asked for a particular whiskey and once again he had to return a minute later to ask about my order
The manager did come over, apologized for the confusion of the evening and made the situation right.
4) Spa Solage - We arrived for our 50 minute Couples Massage spa appointment early as requested, my wife confirmed with the hostess her prenatal massage, and we were given a quick tour. As it turns out my masseur had my appointment time 15 minutes earlier and my wife's masseur arrived for her 15 minutes later than our same scheduled times. I'm not a massage person (1 every 8 years), but I thought our Couples Massage meant we would be in a room together. As it turns out we were in separate rooms. I could have said something, but I was under the impression my wife had already been was whisked away to her massage. After our massages we met by the heated pool, had a snack and a smoothie for a snack before our mudslide. My wife informed of the delay with her appointment, that her massage was actually a little more that 30 minutes, and that when walking to her massage room she mentioned to her masseur about her prenatal massage. This news was a surprise to him and he had to get more pillows. Afterwards we did the spas Mudslide experience which was very relaxing. Each stage of the experience just took us one step closer to relaxation. So much so that we returned to the room and my wife took an hour nap.
5) Other Stuff - Rooms come with two bikes each which was fun. Unfortunately because of the rain we couldn't have our typical cut-throat bocce contest.",
4,Spa!,"I'm rarely impressed or excited by a spa, but that's definitely this property's greatest asset. Came here with some friends for a birthday getaway, and enjoyed all the spa had to offer. The mudslide experience is amazing, and every aspect of the spa is incredibly luxurious. The staff is generous and friendly, and our breakfast at Solbar was fantastic. The rooms were nice enough, but that wouldn't be the greatest draw. Come for the spa and great service!",
5,Best Escape,I stayed here a couple weeks ago and had the best few days! Check in was wonderful- I arrived early so I went to the bar and the gentleman at the front desk came and got me when my room was ready. The food and drinks at the restaurant were wonderful and it was a treat that my waiter in the morning remembered my order from the previous day! The personal service was noticed. The atmosphere was quiet and relaxing without feeling isolated. Everything about Solage was wonderful. I was so sad to leave and can't wait to go back! :),
5,Great service and spa,"We thought his hotel was such a delight. Is a place for complete relaxation and pampering, if you are wiling to pay for it. The price of the spa services are at a premium. The grounds and pools are very well maintained. The service is excellent. Basically, a pleasurable experience!",
5,Harvest Week Must,Excellent management and amenities at this resort nestled in the heart of Napa. Complimentary beach combers and Mercedes Benz during your stay set the tone for an incredible experience in California’s wine country.,
5,So Glad I Visited - Will Go AGAIN,"Over 7 years ago I heard about this hotel. I fell in love with the pictures on line but never seemed to get there. Last May, my husband and I took off to California and found our way to Solage Calistoga. I was even more impressed than I was when I drooled over the photos. Our room was a small little cabin that was beautifully done in a 5 star manner. It was spotless. We had a private outdoor patio where we sipped a whole bottle of champagne, courtesy of the hotel! The spa was amazing as was the gym. I took a pilates class one morning and it was really well taught! We had a very peaceful stay with great staff that helped us navigate the wineries. The food was very good, we had breakfast each day and had a very lovely dinner one night. Now that we are home, my husband and I talk about WHEN we will go back...not if!
Hope to see you soon!",
2,Bring back Auberge,"After many, many memorable stays here at Solage, we were deeply disappointed on this visit.

We booked the 3 night stay (3 rooms) with the 4th night free which was not honored due to the 4th night falling on New Years Eve, even though the website showed it as available. After a few discussions with the management they twisted the situation, claiming that we did not book the rooms correctly In addition the back pool area and mens spa is in desperate need of a major facelift with faded paint, dirty pool and equipment not working in spa.
Quite frankly, if it wasn't for the incredible food at Solbar, we would have stayed down in Yountville or Napa.
I wonder out loud if the separation from the Auberge management group last is the cause for this obvious decline in service and upkeep?
With the Four Seasons soon to be opening across the road and the Auberge right down the street the new options ""may"" get them back to a more customer focused experience.",
5,Lovely resort and spa,"I just returned from a weekend away at Solage with my family, and I can't say enough good things about this resort! We booked through Jetsetter and got a great deal. Here's what we loved:

The entire resort was just lovely - beautiful pools, well-designed studios, great spaces for lounging, pretty yoga studio, etc.

They truly thought through every amenity you could want then when above and beyond to deliver. We especially LOVED the fun cruiser bikes at every studio and around the resort. We rode around the resort and into town (about 5 minutes by bike). They also had lovely toiletries, nice robes, etc.

The food at Solbar was great, as you would expect. We were more impressed by the breakfast than the dinner. I would highly recommend the lemon ricotta pancakes.

The spa treatment and spa pools were just lovely. I had a massage, which was nice, but I really enjoyed the various bathing pools in the spa. There is a big hot spring / mineral pool (basically a big hot tub) in the spa with lots of cabanas and beach chairs around. There are also clothing optional women- and men-only pools with a hot pool, cold pool, steam room, and outdoor shower. There is a spa menu that they will deliver to you at these pools (including the clothing optional ones!) --- I highly recommend the spatinis and the guac.

We also enjoyed the gym. The gym itself was nicely designed and had a good amount of new equipment. Hotel guests also get full access to the class; we really like the yoga, which was fun for all levels.

The area is just gorgeous. We went on many nice bike rides and hikes in and around Calistoga. We went in the winter (around Christmas), but the weather was in the upper 60s with clear blue skies (okay...after the fog burned off).

And last but not least, the staff really went above and beyond to deliver. Everyone was friendly and helpful! Highly recommend!",
5,"Resort stay Dec 26, 2014 weekend","We are staying at the Solage resort in the king size cottage. The front desk was very friendly. Wendy was gracious enough to explain the layout and the amenities of the resort. The room has a spacious patio, spacious shower room, and comfortable bed. You must dine at Solbar restaurant. Michelin star rated.
We had the mud scrub treatment at the spa. Roberto and Eli did an excellent job of guiding us through the three step treatment. And there are coed geothermal pool as well as women only and men only geothermal pool. Overall an awesome experience.",
5,Wine Country's FINEST!!!,"This resort has everything to enjoy the wine country. Just spent our 4th Christmas holiday here...and it has gotten BETTER.
Studio cottages that are beautifully designed, each with its own private patio. Michellin star restaurant (Sol Bar) a short walk away (unless you want to use one of the bikes each guest gets). A spa that has everything including expert masseurs (ask for Robert for his deep tissue massage).And they are dog friendly too!!! Huge acreage and friendly staff.",
4,Nice Resort - Great for relaxing,Very nice property. Good size gym with all types of fitness equipment. Spa has many offerings and is a feature of the resort. They leave you coffee in the room you can brew on your own. Beds are comfortable. Big shower.,
4,Relaxing venue for overnight business meetings,"We held a 2½ -day business meeting at Solage in Calistoga. The meeting room was simple but adequate and the grounds and layout were both beautiful and peaceful. All rooms were individual cabins that were stylishly decorated with contemporary furnishings. The food (breakfast, lunch, dinner) was fresh and geared towards healthy and local items; it also included fish and vegetarian items. It rained most of the time for the meeting, and there were complimentary umbrellas distributed in the rooms and all over the property. The staff was friendly and went out of their way to be helpful. Although I did not take advantage of the spa offerings, those who did said that they were relaxing and enjoyable. The wifi worked extremely well and was fast.",
4,Romantic enough for a getaway fun enough for a girls weekend.,"Great resort, it is not quite as clean and sharp as when they first opened- but great for summer with a big pool for lounging and a great spa. I love the room service breakfast and the modern rooms. The bar and restaurant are a destination on their own.... Make reservations.",
